    <p>
      The incident was of a dignity which the supernatural has by no means
      always had, and which has been more than ever lacking in it since the
      manifestations of professional spiritualism began to vulgarize it. Hewson
      appreciated this as soon as he realized that he had been confronted with
      an apparition. He had been very little agitated at the moment, and it was
      not till later, when the conflict between sense and reason concerning the
      fact itself arose, that he was aware of any perturbation. Even then,
      amidst the tumult of his whirling emotions he had a sort of central calm,
      in which he noted the particulars of the occurrence with distinctness and
      precision. He had always supposed that if anything of the sort happened to
      him he would be greatly frightened, but he had not been at all frightened,
      so far as he could make out. His hair had not risen, or his cheek felt a
      chill; his heart had not lost or gained a beat in its pulsation; and his
      prime conclusion was that if the Mysteries had chosen him an agent in
      approaching the material world they had not made a mistake. This becomes
      grotesque in being put into words, but the words do not misrepresent,
      except by their inevitable excess, the mind in which Hewson rose, and
      flung open his shutters to let in the dawn upon the scene of the
      apparition, which he now perceived must have been, as it were,
      self-lighted. The robins were yelling from the trees and the sparrows
      bickering under them; catbirds were calling from the thickets of syringa,
      and in the nearest woods a hermit-thrush was ringing its crystal bells.
      The clear day was penetrating the east with the subtle light which
      precedes the sun, and a summer sweetness rose cool from the garden below,
      gray with dew.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the solitude of the hour there was an intimation of privity to the
      event which had taken place, an implication of the unity of the natural
      and the supernatural, strangely different from that robust gayety of the
      plain day which later seemed to disown the affair, and leave the burden of
      proof altogether to the human witness. By this time Hewson had already set
      about to putting it in such phrases as should carry conviction to the
      hearer, and yet should convey to him no suspicion of the pride which
      Hewson felt in the incident as a sort of tribute to himself. He dramatized
      the scene at breakfast when he should describe it in plain, matter-of-fact
      terms, and hold every one spellbound, as he or she leaned forward over the
      table to listen, while he related the fact with studied unconcern for his
      own part in it, but with a serious regard for the integrity of the fact
      itself, which he had no wish to exaggerate as to its immediate meaning or
      remoter implications. It did not yet occur to him that it had none; they
      were simply to be matters of future observation in a second ordeal; for
      the first emotion which the incident imparted was the feeling that it
      would happen again, and in this return would interpret itself. Hewson was
      so strongly persuaded of something of the kind, that after standing for an
      indefinite period at the window in his pajamas, he got hardily back into
      bed, and waited for the repetition. He was agreeably aware of waiting
      without a tremor, and rather eagerly than otherwise; then he began to feel
      drowsy, and this at first flattered him, as a proof of his strange courage
      in circumstances which would have rendered sleep impossible to most men;
      but in another moment he started from it. If he slept every one would say
      he had dreamt the whole thing; and he could never himself be quite sure
      that he had not.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up, and began to dress, thinking all the time, in a dim way, how
      very long it would be till breakfast, and wondering what he should do till
      then with his appetite and his apparition. It was now only a little after
      four o&rsquo;clock of the June morning, and nobody would be down till after
      eight; most people at that very movable feast, which St. John had in the
      English fashion, did not show themselves before nine. It was impossible to
      get a book and read for five hours; he would be dropping with hunger if he
      walked so long. Yet he must not sleep; and he must do something to keep
      from sleeping. He remembered a little interloping hotel, which had lately
      forced its way into precincts sacred to cottage life, and had impudently
      called itself the St. Johnswort Inn, after St. John&rsquo;s place, by a name
      which he prided himself on having poetically invented from his own and
      that of a prevalent wild flower. Upon the chance of getting an early cup
      of coffee at this hotel, Hewson finished dressing, and crept down stairs
      to let himself out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He not only found the door locked, as he had expected, but the key taken
      out; and after some misgiving he decided to lift one of the long library
      windows, from which he could get into the garden, closing the window after
      him, and so make his escape. No one was stirring outside the house any
      more than within; he knocked down a trellis by which a clematis was trying
      to climb over the window he emerged from, and found his way out of the
      grounds without alarming any one. He was not so successful at the hotel,
      where a lank boy, sweeping the long piazzas, recognized one of the St.
      Johnswort guests in the figure approaching the steps, and apparently had
      his worst fears roused for Hewson&rsquo;s sanity when Hewson called to him and
      wondered if he could get a cup of coffee at that hour; he openly owned it
      was an unnatural hour, and he had a fine inward sense that it was
      supernatural. The boy dropped his broom without a word, and vanished
      through the office door, reappearing after a blank interval to pick up his
      broom and say, &ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; as he began sweeping again. It was well, for
      one reason that he did not state his belief too confidently, Hewson
      thought; but after another interval of unknown length a rude, sad girl
      came to tell him his coffee was waiting for him. He followed her back into
      the still dishevelled dining room, and sat down at a long table to a cup
      of lukewarm drink that in color and quality recalled terrible mornings of
      Atlantic travel when he haplessly rose and descended to the dining-saloon
      of the steamer, and had a marine version of British coffee brought him by
      an alien table-steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered the pock-marked nose of one alien steward, and how he had
      questioned whether he should give the fellow six-pence or a shilling,
      seeing that apart from this tribute he should have to fee his own steward
      for the voyage; at the same time his fancy played with the question
      whether that uncouth, melancholy waitress had found a moment to wash her
      face before hurrying to fetch his coffee. He amused himself by contrasting
      her sloven dejection with the brisk neatness of the service at St.
      Johnswort; but through all he never lost the awe, the sense of
      responsibility which he bore to the vision vouchsafed him, doubtless for
      some reason and to some end that it behooved him to divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found a yesterday&rsquo;s paper in the office of the hotel, and read it till
      he began to drowse over it, when he pulled himself up with a sharp jerk.
      He discovered that it was now six o&rsquo;clock, and he thought if he could walk
      about for an hour he might return to St. Johnswort, and worry through the
      remaining hour till breakfast somehow. He was still framing in his
      thoughts some sort of statement concerning the apparition which he should
      make when the largest number of guests had got together at the table, with
      a fine question whether he should take them between the cantaloupe and the
      broiled chicken, or wait till they had come to the corn griddle-cakes,
      which St. John&rsquo;s cook served of a filigree perfection in homage to the
      good old American breakfast ideal. There would be more women, if he
      waited, and he should need the sympathy and countenance of women; his
      story would be wanting in something of its supreme effect without the
      electrical response of their keener nerves. <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      When Hewson came up to the cottage he was sensible of a certain agitation
      in the air, which was intensified to him by the sight of St. John, in his
      bare, bald head and the négligé of a flannel housecoat, inspecting, with
      the gardener and one of the grooms, the fallen trellis under the library
      window, which from time to time they looked up at, as they talked. Hewson
      made haste to join them, through the garden gate, and to say shamefacedly
      enough, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m responsible for that,&rdquo; and he told how he must
      have thrown down the trellis in getting out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said St. John, while the two men walked away with dissatisfied grins
      at being foiled of their sensation. &ldquo;We thought it was burglars. I&rsquo;m so
      glad it was only you.&rdquo; But in spite of his profession, St. John did not
      give Hewson any very lively proof of his enjoyment. &ldquo;Deuced uncomfortable
      to have had one&rsquo;s guests murdered in their beds. Don&rsquo;t say anything about
      it, please, Hewson. The women would all fly the premises, if there&rsquo;d been
      even a suspicion of burglars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Hewson willingly assented; but he perceived a
      disappointment in St. John&rsquo;s tone and manner, and he suspected him,
      however unjustly, of having meant to give himself importance with his
      guests by the rumor of a burglary in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a man quite capable of that, Hewson believed, and failing it,
      capable of pretending that he wanted the matter hushed up in the interest
      of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case he saw that it was not to St. John primarily, or secondarily
      to St. John&rsquo;s guests, that he could celebrate the fact of his apparition.
      In the presence of St. John&rsquo;s potential vulgarity he keenly felt his own,
      and he recoiled from what he had imagined doing. He even realized that he
      would have been working St. John an injury by betraying his house to his
      guests as the scene of a supernatural incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody believes in ghosts, but there is not one in a thousand of us who
      would not be uncomfortable in a haunted house, or a house so reputed. If
      Hewson told what he had seen, he would not only scatter St. John&rsquo;s
      house-party to the four winds, but he would cast such a blight upon St.
      Johnswort that it would never sell for a tenth of its cost. <br /> <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      From that instant Hewson renounced his purpose, and he remained true to
      this renunciation in spite of the behavior of St. John, which might well
      have tempted him to a revenge in kind. No one seemed to have slept late
      that morning; several of the ladies complained that they had not slept a
      wink the whole night, and two or three of the men owned to having waked
      early and not been able to hit it off again in a morning nap, though it
      appeared that they were adepts in that sort of thing. The hour of their
      vigils corresponded so nearly with that of Hewson&rsquo;s apparition that he
      wondered if a mystical influence from it had not penetrated the whole
      house. The adventitious facts were of such a nature that he controlled
      with the greater difficulty the wish to explode upon an audience so aptly
      prepared for it the prodigious incident which he was keeping in reserve;
      but he did not yield even when St. John carefully led up to the point
      through the sensation of his guests, by recounting the evidences of the
      supposed visit of a burglar, and then made his effect by suddenly turning
      upon Hewson, and saying with his broad guffaw: &ldquo;And here you have the
      burglar in person. He has owned his crime to me, and I&rsquo;ve let him off the
      penalty on condition that he tells you all about it.&rdquo; The humor was not
      too rank for the horsey people whom St. John had mainly about him, but
      some of the women said, &ldquo;Poor Mr. Hewson!&rdquo; when the host, failing Hewson&rsquo;s
      confession, went on to betray that he had risen at that unearthly hour to
      go down to the St. Johnswort Inn for a cup of its famous coffee. The
      coffee turned out to be the greatest kind of joke; one of the men asked
      Hewson if he could say on his honor that it was really any better than St.
      John&rsquo;s coffee there before them, and another professed to be in a secret
      more recondite than had yet been divined: it was that long grim girl, who
      served it; she had lured Hewson from his rest at five o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning; and this humorist proposed a Welsh rarebit some night at the inn,
      where they could all see for themselves why Hewson broke out of the house
      and smashed a trellis before sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hewson sat silent, not even attempting a defensive sally. In fact it was
      only his surface mind which was employed with what was going on; as
      before, his deeper thought was again absorbed with his great experience.
      He could not, if his conscience had otherwise suffered him, have spoken of
      it in that company, and the laughter died away from his silence as if it
      had been his offence. He was not offended, but he was ashamed, and not
      ashamed so much for St. John as for himself, that he could have ever
      imagined acquiring merit in such company by exploiting an experience which
      should have been sacred to him. How could he have been so shabby? He was
      justly punished in the humiliating contrast between being the butt of
      these poor wits, and the hero of an incident which, whatever its real
      quality was, had an august character of mystery. He had recognized this
      from the first instant; he had perceived that the occurrence was for him,
      and for him alone, until he had reasoned some probable meaning into it or
      from it; and yet he had been willing, he saw it, he owned it! to win the
      applause of that crowd as a man who had just seen a ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought of them as that crowd, but after all, they were good-natured
      people, and when they fancied that he was somehow vexed with the turn the
      talk had taken, they began to speak of other things; St. John himself led
      the way, and when he got Hewson alone after breakfast, he made him a sort
      of amend. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to annoy you, old fellow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with my
      story about the burglary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Hewson brisked up in response, as he took the
      cigar St. John offered him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I must have seemed rather stupid.
      I had got to thinking about something else, and I couldn&rsquo;t pull myself
      away from it. I wasn&rsquo;t annoyed at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether St. John thought this sufficient gratitude for his reparation did
      not appear. As Hewson did not offer to break the silence in which they
      went on smoking, his host made a pretext, toward the end of their cigars,
      after bearing the burden of the conversation apparently as long as he
      could, of being reminded of something by the group of women descending
      into the garden from the terraced walk beyond it and then slowly, with
      little pauses, trailing their summer draperies among the flower-beds and
      bushes toward the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by-the-way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should like to introduce you to Miss
      Hernshaw; she came last night with Mrs. Rock: that tall girl, there,
      lagging behind a little. She&rsquo;s an original.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I noticed her at breakfast,&rdquo; Hewson answered, now first aware of having
      been struck with the strange beauty and strange behavior of the slim girl,
      who drooped in her chair, with her little head fallen forward, and played
      with her bread, ignoring her food otherwise, while she listened with a
      bored air to the talk which made Hewson its prey. She had an effect of
      being both shy and indifferent, in this retrospect; and when St. John put
      up the window, and led the way out to the women in the garden, and
      presented Hewson, she had still this effect. She did not smile or speak in
      acknowledgement of Hewson&rsquo;s bow; she merely looked at him with a sort of
      swift intensity, and then, when one of the women said, &ldquo;We were coming to
      view the scene of your burglarious exploit, Mr. Hewson. Was that the very
      window?&rdquo; the girl looked impatiently away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very window,&rdquo; Hewson owned. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t know it. St. John has had
      the trellis put up and the spot fresh turfed,&rdquo; and he detached the
      interlocutory widow in the direction of their bachelor host, as she
      perhaps intended he should, and dropped back to the side of Miss Hernshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was almost spiritually slender. In common with all of us, he had heard
      that shape of girl called willowy, but he made up his mind that
      sweetbriery would be the word for Miss Hernshaw, in whose face a virginal
      youth suggested the tender innocence and surprise of the flower, while the
      droop of her figure, at once delicate and self-reliant, arrested the fancy
      with a sense of the pendulous thorny spray. She looked not above sixteen
      in age, but as she was obviously out, in the society sense of the word,
      this must have been a moral effect; and Hewson was casting about in his
      mind for some appropriate form of thought and language to make talk in
      when she abruptly addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; she said, with her face still away, &ldquo;why people make fun of
      those poor girls who have to work in that sort of public way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hewson silently picked his steps back through the intervening events to
      the drolling at breakfast, and with some misgiving took his stand in the
      declaration, &ldquo;You mean the waitress at the inn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; cried the girl, with a gentle indignation, which was so dear to the
      young man that he would have given anything to believe that it veiled a
      measure of sympathy for himself as well as for the waitress. &ldquo;We went in
      there last night when we arrived, for some pins--Mrs. Rock had had her
      dress stepped on, getting out of the car--and that girl brought them. I
      never saw such a sad face. And she was very nice; she had no more manners
      than a cow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hernshaw added the last sentence as if it followed, and in his poor
      masculine pride of sequence Hewson wanted to ask if that were why she was
      so nice; but he obeyed a better instinct in saying, &ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s a whole
      tragedy in it. I wonder if it&rsquo;s potential or actual.&rdquo; He somehow felt safe
      in being so metaphysical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it make any difference?&rdquo; Miss Hernshaw demanded, whirling her face
      round, and fixing him with eyes of beautiful fierceness. &ldquo;Tragedy is
      tragedy, whether you have lived it or not, isn&rsquo;t it? And sometimes it&rsquo;s
      all the more tragical if you have it still to live: you&rsquo;ve got it before
      you! I don&rsquo;t see how any one can look at that girl&rsquo;s face and laugh at
      her. I should never forgive any one who did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t do any of the laughing,&rdquo; said Hewson, willing to
      relieve himself from the strain of this high mood, and yet anxious not to
      fall too far below it. &ldquo;Perhaps I should, though, if I hadn&rsquo;t been the
      victim of it in some degree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the vulgarest thing I ever heard!&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hewson looked at her, but she had averted her face again. He had a longing
      to tell her of his apparition which quelled every other interest in him,
      and, as it were, blurred his whole consciousness. She would understand,
      with her childlike truth, and with her unconventionality she would not
      find it strange that he should speak to her of such a thing for no
      apparent reason or no immediate cause. He walked silent at her side,
      revolving his longing in his thought, and hating the circumstance which
      forbade him to speak at once. He did not know how long he was lost in
      this, when he was suddenly recalled to fearful question of the fact by her
      saying, with another flash of her face toward him, &ldquo;You _have_ lost sleep
      Mr. Hewson!&rdquo; and she whipped forward, and joined the other women, who were
      following the lead of St. John and the widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rock, to whom Hewson had been presented at the same time as to Miss
      Hernshaw, looked vaguely back at him over her shoulder, but made no
      attempt to include him in her group, and he thought, for no reason, that
      she was kept from doing so on account of Miss Hernshaw. He thought he
      could be no more mistaken in this than in the resentment of Miss Hernshaw,
      which he was aware of meriting, however unintentionally. Later, after
      lunch, he made sure of this fact when Mrs. Rock got him into a corner, and
      cozily began, &ldquo;I always feel like explaining Rosalie a little,&rdquo; and then
      her vague, friendly eye wandered toward Miss Hernshaw across the room, and
      stopped, as if waiting for the girl to look away. But Miss Hernshaw did
      not look away, and that afternoon, Hewson&rsquo;s week being up, he left St.
      Johnswort before dinner. <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The time came, before the following winter, when Hewson was tempted beyond
      his strength, and told the story of his apparition. He told it more than
      once, and kept himself with increasing difficulty from lying about it. He
      always wished to add something, to amplify the fact, to heighten the
      mystery of the circumstances, to divine the occult significance of the
      incident. In itself the incident, when stated, was rather bare and
      insufficient; but he held himself rigidly to the actual details, and he
      felt that in this at least he was offering the powers which had vouchsafed
      him the experience a species of atonement for breaking faith with them. It
      seemed like breaking faith with Miss Hernshaw, too, though this impression
      would have been harder to reason than the other. Both impressions began to
      wear off after the first tellings of the story; the wound that Hewson gave
      his sensibility in the very first cicatrized before the second, and at the
      fourth or fifth it had quite calloused over; so that he did not mind
      anything so much as what always seemed to him the inadequate effect of his
      experience with his hearers. Some listened carelessly; some nervously;
      some incredulously, as if he were trying to put up a job on them; some
      compassionately, as if he were not quite right, and ought to be looked
      after. There was a consensus of opinion, among those who offered any sort
      of comment, that he ought to give it to the Psychical Research, and at the
      bottom of Hewson&rsquo;s heart, there was a dread that the spiritualists would
      somehow get hold of him. This remained to stay him, when the shame of
      breaking faith with Miss Hernshaw and with Mystery no longer restrained
      him from exploiting the fact. He was aware of lying in wait for
      opportunities of telling it, and he swore himself to tell it only upon
      direct provocation, or when the occasion seemed imperatively to demand it.
      He commonly brought it out to match some experience of another; but he
      could never deny a friendly appeal when he sat with some good fellows over
      their five-o&rsquo;clock cocktails at the club, and one of them would say in
      behalf of a newcomer, &ldquo;Hewson, tell Wilkins that odd thing that happened
      to you up country, in the summer.&rdquo; In complying he tried to save his
      self-respect by affecting a contemptuous indifference in the matter, and
      beginning reluctantly and pooh-poohingly. He had pangs afterwards as he
      walked home to dress for dinner, but his self-reproach was less afflicting
      as time passed. His suffering from it was never so great as from the
      slight passed upon his apparition, when Wilkins or what other it might be,
      would meet the suggestion that he should tell him about it, with the
      hurried interposition, &ldquo;Yes, I have heard that; good story.&rdquo; This would
      make Hewson think that he was beginning to tell his story too often, and
      that perhaps the friend who suggested his doing so, was playing upon his
      forgetfulness. He wondered if he were really something of a bore with it,
      and whether men were shying off from him at the club on account of it. He
      fancied that might be the reason why the circle at the five-o&rsquo;clock
      cocktails gradually diminished as the winter passed. He continued to join
      it till the chance offered of squarely refusing to tell Wilkins, or
      whoever, about the odd thing that had happened to him up country in the
      summer. Then he felt that he had in a manner retrieved himself, and could
      retire from the five-o&rsquo;clock cocktails with honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      That it was a veridical phantom which had appeared to him he did not in
      his inmost at all doubt, though in his superficial consciousness he
      questioned it, not indeed so disrespectfully as he pooh-poohed it to
      others, but still questioned it. This he thought somehow his due as a man
      of intelligence who ought not to suffer himself to fall into superstition
      even upon evidence granted to few. Superficially, however, as well as
      interiorly, he was aware of always expecting its repetition; and now, six
      months after the occurrence this expectation was as vivid with him as it
      was the first moment after the vision had vanished, while his tongue was
      yet in act to stay it with speech. He would not have been surprised at any
      time in walking into his room to find It there; or waking at night to
      confront It in the electric flash which he kindled by a touch of the
      button at his bedside. Rather, he was surprised that nothing of the sort
      happened, to confirm him in his belief that he had been all but in touch
      with the other life, or to give him some hint, the slightest, the dimmest,
      why this vision had been shown him, and then instantly broken and
      withdrawn. In that inmost of his where he recognized its validity, he
      could not deny that it had a meaning, and that it had been sent him for
      some good reason special to himself; though at the times when he had
      prefaced his story of it with terms of slighting scepticism, he had
      professed neither to know nor to care why the thing had happened. He
      always said that he had never been particularly interested in the
      supernatural, and then was ashamed of a lie that was false to universal
      human experience; but he could truthfully add that he had never in his
      life felt less like seeing a ghost than that morning. It was not full day,
      but it was perfectly light, and there the thing was, as palpable to vision
      as any of the men that moment confronting him with cocktails in their
      hands. Asked if he did not think he had dreamed it, he answered scornfully
      that he did not think, he _knew_, he had not dreamed it; he did not value
      the experience, it was and had always been perfectly meaningless, but he
      would stake his life upon its reality. Asked if it had not perhaps been
      the final office of a nightcap, he disdained to answer at all, though he
      did not openly object to the laugh which the suggestion raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secretly, within his inmost, Hewson felt justly punished by the laughter.
      He had been unworthy of his apparition in lightly exposing it to such a
      chance; he had fallen below the dignity of his experience. He might never
      hope to fathom its meaning while he lived; but he grieved for the wrong he
      had done it, as if at the instant of the apparition he had offered that
      majestic, silent figure some grotesque indignity: thrown a pillow at it,
      or hailed it in tones of mocking offence. He was profoundly and
      exquisitely ashamed even before he ceased to tell the story for his
      listeners&rsquo; idle amusement. When he stopped doing so, and snubbed
      solicitation with the curt answer that everybody had heard that story, he
      was retrospectively ashamed; and mixed with the expectation of seeing the
      vision again was the formless wish to offer it some sort of reparation, of
      apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      He longed to prove himself not wholly unworthy of the advance that had
      been made him from the other world upon grounds which he had done his
      worst to prove untenable. He could not imagine what the grounds were,
      though he had to admit their probable existence; such an event might have
      no obvious or present significance, but it had not happened for nothing;
      it could not have happened for nothing. Hewson might not have been in what
      he thought any stressful need of ghostly comfort or reassurance in matters
      of faith. He was not inordinately agnostic, or in the way of becoming so.
      He was simply an average skeptical American, who denied no more than he
      affirmed, and who really concerned himself so little about his soul,
      though he tried to keep his conscience decently clean, that he had not
      lately asked whether other people had such a thing or not. He had not lost
      friends, and he was so much alone in this world that it seemed improbable
      the fate of any uncle or cousin, in the absence of more immediate kindred,
      should be mystically forecast to him. He was perfectly well at the time of
      the apparition, and it could not have been the figment of a disordered
      digestion, as the lusty hunger which willingly appeased itself with the
      coffee of the St. Johnswort Inn sufficiently testified. Yet, in spite of
      all this, an occurrence so out of the course of events must have had some
      message for him, and it must have been his fault that he could not divine
      it. A sense of culpability grew upon him with the sense of his ignominy in
      cheapening it by making it subservient to what he knew was, in the last
      analysis, a wretched vanity. At least he could refuse himself that
      miserable gratification hereafter, and he got back some measure of
      self-respect in forbidding himself the pleasure he might have taken in
      being noted for a strange experience he could never be got to speak of.
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      V.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The implication of any such study as this is that the subject of it is
      continuously if not exclusively occupied with the matter which is supposed
      to make him interesting. But of course it was not so with Hewson, who
      perhaps did not think of his apparition once in a fortnight, or oftener,
      say, than he thought of the odd girl with whom for no reason, except
      contemporaneity in his acquaintance, he associated with it. If he never
      thought of the apparition without subconsciously expecting its return, he
      equally expected when he thought of Miss Hernshaw that the chances of
      society would bring them together again, and it was with no more surprise
      than if the vision had intimated its second approach that he one night
      found her name in the minute envelope which the footman presented him at a
      house where he was going to dine, and realized that he was appointed to
      take her out. It was a house where he rather liked to go, for in that New
      York of his where so few houses had any distinctive character, this one
      had a temperament of its own in so far that you might expect to meet
      people of temperament there, if anywhere. They were indeed held in a
      social solution where many other people of no temperament at all floated
      largely and loosely about, but they were there, all the same, and it was
      worth coming on the chance of meeting them, though the indiscriminate
      hospitality of the hostess might let the evening pass without promoting
      the chance. Now, however, she had unwittingly put into Hewson&rsquo;s keeping,
      for two hours at least, the very temperament that had kept his fancy for
      the last half-year and more. He fairly laughed at sight of the name on the
      little card, and hurried into the drawing-room, where the first thing
      after greeting his hostess, he caught the wandering look and vague smile
      of Mrs. Rock. The look and the smile became personal to him, and she
      welcomed him with a curious resumption of the confidential terms in which
      they had seemed to part that afternoon at St. Johnswort. He thought that
      she was going to begin talking to him where she had left off, about
      Rosalie, as she had called her, and he was disappointed in the
      commonplaces that actually ensued. At the end of these, however, she did
      say: &ldquo;Miss Hernshaw is here with me. Have you seen her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Hewson returned, for he had caught sight of the girl in a
      distant group, on his way up to Mrs. Rock, but in view of the affluent
      opportunity before him had richly forborne trying even to make her bow to
      him, though he believed she had seen him. &ldquo;I am to have the happiness of
      going out with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rock, &ldquo;that is nice,&rdquo; and then the people began
      assorting themselves, and the man who was appointed to take Mrs. Rock out,
      came and bowed Hewson away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hastened to that corner of the room where Miss Hernshaw was waiting,
      and if he had been suddenly confronted with his apparition he could not
      have experienced a deeper and stranger satisfaction than he felt as the
      girl lifted up her innocent fierce face upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It brought back that whole day at St. Johnswort, of which she, with his
      vision, formed the supreme interest and equally the mystery; and it went
      warmly to his heart to have her peremptorily abolish all banalities by
      saying, &ldquo;I was wondering if they were going to give me you, as soon as you
      came in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her slim hand on his arm as she spoke, and he thought she must
      have felt him quiver at her touch. &ldquo;Then you were not afraid they were
      going to give you me?&rdquo; he bantered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I wanted to talk with you. I wanted you to tell me what
      Mrs. Rock said about me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just now? She said you were here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I mean that day at St. Johnswort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hewson laughed out for pleasure in her frankness, and then he felt a
      gathering up of his coat-sleeve under her nervous fingers, as if (such a
      thing being imaginable) she were going unwittingly to pinch him for his
      teasing. &ldquo;She said she wanted to explain you a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then what!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then nothing. She seemed to catch your eye, and she stopped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fingers relaxed their hold upon that gathering up of his coat-sleeve.
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t _be_ explained, and I have told her so. If I choose to act
      myself, and show out my real thoughts and feelings, how is it any worse
      than if I acted somebody else!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it was very much better,&rdquo; said Hewson, inwardly warned to
      keep his face straight. <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      VI.
    </h3>
    <p>
      They had time for no more talk between the drawing-room and the dinner
      table, and when Miss Hernshaw&rsquo;s chair had been pushed in behind her, and
      she sat down, she turned instantly to the man on her right and began
      speaking to him, and left Hewson to make conversation with any one he
      liked or could.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not get on very well, not because there were not enough amusing
      people beside him and over against him, but because he was all the time
      trying to eavesdrop what was saying between Miss Hernshaw and the man on
      her right. It seemed to be absolute trivialities they were talking; so far
      as Hewson made out they got no deeper than the new play which was then
      commanding the public favor apparently for the reason that it was
      altogether surface, with no measure upwards or downwards. Upon this
      surface the comment of the man on Miss Hernshaw&rsquo;s right wandered
      indefatigably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hewson could not imagine of her sincerity a deliberate purpose of letting
      the poor fellow show all the shallowness that was in him, and of amusing
      itself with his satisfaction in turning his empty mind inside out for her
      inspection. She seemed, if not genuinely interested, to be paying him an
      unaffected attention; but when the lady across the table addressed a word
      to him, Miss Hernshaw, as if she had been watching for some such chance,
      instantly turned to Hewson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of &lsquo;Ghosts&rsquo;?&rdquo; she asked, with imperative suddenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ghosts?&rdquo; he echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or perhaps you didn&rsquo;t go?&rdquo; she suggested, and he perceived that she meant
      Ibsen&rsquo;s tragedy. But he did not answer at once. He had had a shock, and
      for a timeless space he had been back in his room at St. Johnswort, with
      that weird figure seated at his table. It seemed to vanish again when he
      gave a second glance, as it had vanished before, and he drew a long sigh,
      and looked a little haggardly at Miss Hernshaw. &ldquo;Ah, I see you did! Wasn&rsquo;t
      it tremendous? I think the girl who did Regina was simply awful, don&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Hewson, still so trammeled in his own involuntary
      associations with the word as not fully to realize the strangeness of
      discussing &ldquo;Ghosts&rdquo; with a young lady. But he pulled himself together, and
      nimbly making his reflection that the latitude of the stage gave room for
      the meeting of cultivated intelligences in regions otherwise tabooed, if
      they were of opposite sexes, he responded in kind. &ldquo;I think that the
      greatest miracle of the play--and to me it was altogether miraculous"--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say that!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;It was the greatest
      experience of my life. I can&rsquo;t bear to have people undervalue it. I want
      to hit them. But go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hewson went on as gravely as he could in view of her potential violence:
      he pictured Miss Hernshaw beating down the inadequate witnesses of
      &ldquo;Ghosts&rdquo; with her fan, which lay in her lap, with her cobwebby
      handkerchief, drawn through its ring, and her long limp gloves looking
      curiously like her pretty young arms in their slenderness. &ldquo;I was merely
      going to say that the most prodigious effect of the play was among the
      actors--I won&rsquo;t venture on the spectators--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t! It isn&rsquo;t speakable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s astonishing the effect a play of Ibsen&rsquo;s has with the actors. They
      can&rsquo;t play false. It turns the merest theatrical sticks into men and
      women, and it does it through the perfect honesty of the dramatist. He
      deals so squarely with himself that they have to deal squarely with
      themselves. They have to be, and not just _seem_.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hernshaw sighed deeply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think that,&rdquo; she said, and
      Hewson felt very glad too that he thought that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Because that is what I always want to do; and it&rsquo;s what I always
      shall do, I don&rsquo;t care what they say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know whether I understand exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deal squarely with everybody. Say what I really feel. Then they say what
      they really feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an obscure resentment unworthily struggling at the bottom of
      Hewson&rsquo;s heart for her long neglect of him in behalf of the man on her
      left. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if they are capable of really feeling anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? Everybody really feels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, thinking anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew herself up a little with an air of question. &ldquo;I believe everybody
      really thinks, too, and it&rsquo;s your duty to let them find out what they&rsquo;re
      thinking, by truly saying what you think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then _she_ isn&rsquo;t dealing quite honestly with him,&rdquo; said Hewson, with a
      malicious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man at Miss Hernshaw&rsquo;s left was still talking about the play, and he
      was at that moment getting off a piece of pure parrotry about it to the
      lady across the table: just what everybody had been saying about it from
      the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I should think she was not,&rdquo; said the girl, gravely. She looked hurt,
      as if she had been unfairly forced to the logic of her postulate, and
      Hewson was not altogether pleased with himself; but at least he had had
      his revenge in making her realize the man&rsquo;s vacuity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to get her back to talk about &ldquo;Ghosts,&rdquo; again, but she answered
      with indifference, and just then he was arrested by something a man was
      saying near the head of the table. <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      VII.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was rather a large dinner, but not so large that a striking phrase,
      launched in a momentary lull, could not fuse all the wandering attentions
      in a sole regard. The man who spoke was the psychologist Wanhope, and he
      was saying with a melancholy that mocked itself a little in his smile: &ldquo;I
      shouldn&rsquo;t be particular about seeing a ghost myself. I have seen plenty of
      men who had seen men who had seen ghosts; but I never yet saw a man who
      had seen a ghost. If I had it would go a long way to persuade me of
      ghosts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hewson felt his heart thump in his throat. There was a pause, and it was
      as if all eyes but the eyes of the psychologist turned upon him; these
      rested upon the ice which the servant had just then silently slipped under
      them. Hewson had no reason to think that any of the people present were
      acquainted with his experience, but he thought it safest to take them upon
      the supposition that they had, and after he had said to the psychologist,
      &ldquo;Will you allow me to present him to you?&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid every one
      else knows him too well already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; said his _vis-à-vis_, arching her eyebrows; and others up and down
      the table, looked round or over at Hewson where he sat midway of it with
      Miss Hernshaw drooping beside him. She alone seemed indifferent to his
      pretension; she seemed even insensible of it, as she broke off little
      corners of her ice with her fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      The psychologist fixed his eyes on him with scientific challenge as well
      as scientific interest. &ldquo;Do you mean that _you_ have seen a ghost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes--ghost. Generically--provisionally. We always consider them ghosts,
      don&rsquo;t we, till they prove themselves something else? I once saw an
      apparition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several people who were near-sighted or far-placed put on their
      eye-glasses, to make out whether Hewson were serious; a lady who had a
      handsome forearm put up a lorgnette and inspected him through it; she had
      the air of questioning his taste, and the subtle aura of her censure
      penetrated to him, though she preserved a face of rigid impassivity. He
      returned her stare defiantly, though he was aware of not reaching her
      through the lenses as effectively as she reached him. Most of those who
      prepared themselves to listen seemed to be putting him on trial, and they
      apparently justified themselves in this from the cross-questioning method
      the psychologist necessarily took in his wish to clarify the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long ago was it?&rdquo; he asked, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it after dark?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much after. It was at day-break.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! You were alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You made sure you were not dreaming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made sure of that, instantly. I was not awakened by the apparition. I
      was already fully awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had your mind been running on anything of the kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could have been farther from it. I was thinking what a very long
      while it would be till breakfast.&rdquo; This was not true as to the order of
      the fact; but Hewson could not keep himself from saying it, and it made a
      laugh and created a diversion in his favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long did it seem to last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The vision? That was very curious. The whole affair was quite achronic,
      as I may say. The figure was there and it was not there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It vanished suddenly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say it vanished at all. It ought still to be there. Have you ever
      returned to a place where you had always been wrong as to the points of
      the compass, and found yourself right up to a certain moment as you
      approached, and then without any apparent change, found yourself perfectly
      wrong again? The figure was not there, and it was there, and then it was
      not there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I see what you mean,&rdquo; said the psychologist, warily. &ldquo;The
      evanescence was subjective.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Altogether. But so was the apparescence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Wanhope. &ldquo;You hadn&rsquo;t any headache?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; The psychologist desisted with the effect of letting the defence
      take the witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      A general dissatisfaction diffused itself, and Hewson felt it; but he
      disdained to do anything to appease it. He remained silent for that
      appreciable time which elapsed before his host said, almost
      compassionately, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell us all about it, Mr. Hewson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guests, all but Miss Hernshaw, seemed to return to their impartial
      frame, with a leaning in Hewson&rsquo;s favor, such as the court-room feels when
      the accused is about to testify in his own behalf; the listeners cannot
      help wishing him well, though they may have their own opinions of his
      guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there _isn&rsquo;t_ any &lsquo;all-about-it,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Hewson. &ldquo;The whole thing has
      been stated as to the circumstances and conditions.&rdquo; He could see the
      baffled greed in the eyes of those who were hungering for a morsel of the
      marvellous, and he made it as meagre as he could. He had now no temptation
      to exaggerate the simple fact, and he hurried it out in the fewest
      possible words. <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      VIII.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The general disappointment was evident in the moment of waiting which
      followed upon his almost contemptuous ending. His audience some of them
      took their cue from his own ironical manner, and joked; others looked as
      if they had been trifled with. The psychologist said, &ldquo;Curious.&rdquo; He did
      not go back to his position that belief in ghosts should follow from
      seeing a man who had seen one; he seemed rather annoyed by the encounter.
      The talk took another turn and distributed itself again between contiguous
      persons for the brief time that elapsed before the women were to leave the
      men to their coffee and cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
      When their hostess rose Hewson offered his arm to Miss Hernshaw. She had
      not spoken to him since he had told the story of his apparition. Now she
      said in an undertone so impassioned that every vibration from her voice
      shook his heart, &ldquo;If I were you, I would never tell that story again!&rdquo; and
      she pressed his arm with unconscious intensity, while she looked away from
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe it happened?&rdquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it happened! Why shouldn&rsquo;t I believe that? But that&rsquo;s the very
      reason why I wouldn&rsquo;t have told it. If it happened, it was something
      sacred--awful! Oh, I don&rsquo;t see how you could bear to speak of it at a
      dinner, when people were all torpid with--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped breathlessly, with a break in her voice that sounded just
      short of a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sufficiently ashamed of doing it, and not for the first time,&rdquo;
       he said, in sullen discontent with himself. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve been properly
      punished. You can&rsquo;t think how sick it makes me to realize what a
      detestable sensation I was seeking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not heed what he was saying. &ldquo;Was it that morning at St. Johnswort
      when you got up so early, and went for a cup of coffee at the inn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so! I could follow every instant of it; I could see just how it
      was. If such a thing had happened to me, I would have died before I spoke
      of it at such a time as this. Oh, _why_ do you suppose it happened to
      you?&rdquo; the girl grieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, of all men?&rdquo; said Hewson, with a self-contemptuous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were different,&rdquo; she said absently; then abruptly: &ldquo;What
      are you standing here talking to me so long for? You must go back! All the
      men have gone back,&rdquo; and Hewson perceived that they had arrived in the
      drawing-room, and were conspicuously parleying in the face of a dozen
      interested women witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dining-room he took his way toward a vacant place at the table near
      his host, who was saying behind his cigar to another old fellow: &ldquo;I used
      to know her mother; she was rather original too; but nothing to this girl.
      I don&rsquo;t envy Mrs. Rock her job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what the pay of a chaperon is, but I suppose Hernshaw can
      make it worth her while, if he&rsquo;s like the rest out there,&rdquo; said the other
      old fellow. &ldquo;I imagine he&rsquo;s somewhere in his millions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The host held up one of his fingers. &ldquo;Is that all? I thought more. Mines?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cattle. Ah, Mr. Hewson,&rdquo; said the host, turning to welcome him to the
      chair on his other side. &ldquo;Have a cigar. That was a strong story you gave
      us. It had a good fault, though. It was too short.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      IX.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hewson had begun now to feel a keen, persistent, painful sympathy for the
      apparition itself as for some one whose confidence had been abused; and
      this feeling was none the less, but all the more, poignant because it was
      he himself who was guilty towards it. He pitied it in a sort as if it had
      been the victim of a wrong more shocking perhaps for the want of taste in
      it than for any real turpitude. This was a quality of the event not
      without a strange consolation. In arraying him on the side of the
      apparition, it antagonized him with what he had done, and enabled him to
      renounce and disown it.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the night of that dinner, Hewson did not again tell the story of his
      apparition, though the opportunities to do so now sought him as constantly
      as he had formerly sought them. They offered him a fresh temptation
      through the different perversions of the fact that had got commonly
      abroad, but he resisted this temptation, and let the perversions,
      sometimes annoyingly, sometimes amusingly, but always more and more
      wildly, wide of the reality, take their course. In his reticence he had
      the sense of atoning not only to the apparition but to Miss Hernshaw too.
    </p>
    <p class="ctr">
      <a href="images/illusp012.jpg"><img src="images/illusp012_th.jpg"
       alt="I&rsquo;M AFRAID I&rsquo;M RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT" /></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he met her again, Miss Hernshaw had been carried off to Europe by
      Mrs. Rock, perhaps with the purpose of trying the veteran duplicities of
      that continent in breaking down the insurgent sincerity of her ward.
      Hewson heard that she was not to be gone a great while; it was well into
      the winter when they started, and he understood that they were merely
      going to Rome for the end of the season, and were then going to work
      northward, and after June in London were coming home. He did not fail to
      see her again before she left for any want of wishing, but he did not
      happen to meet her at other houses, and at the house of Mrs. Rock, if she
      had one, he had not been asked to call, or invited to any function. In
      thinking the point over it occurred to Hewson that this was so because he
      was not wanted there, and not wanted by Miss Hernshaw herself; for it had
      been in his brief experience of her that she let people know what she
      wanted, and that with Mrs. Rock, whose character seemed to answer to her
      name but poorly, she had ways of getting what she wanted. If Miss Hernshaw
      had wished to meet him again, he could not doubt that she would have asked
      him, or at the least had him asked to come and see her, and not have left
      it to the social fortutities to bring them together. Towards the end of
      the term which rumor had fixed to her stay abroad Hewson&rsquo;s folly was
      embittered to him in a way that he had never expected in his deepest shame
      and darkest forboding. But evil, like good, does not cease till it has
      fulfilled itself in every possible consequence. It seeing even more active
      and persistent. Good seems to satisfy itself sometimes in the direct
      effect, but evil winds sinuously in and out, and reaches round and over
      and under its wretched author, and strikes him in every tender and fatal
      place, with an ingenuity in finding the places out that seems truly of
      hell. Hewson thought he had paid the principal of his debt in full through
      the hurt to his vanity in failing to gain any sort of consequence from his
      apparition, but the interest of his debt had accumulated, and the sorest
      pinch was in paying the interest. His penalty took the form that was most
      of all distasteful to him: the form of publicity in the Sunday edition of
      a newspaper. A young lady attached to the staff of this journal had got
      hold of his story, and had made her reporter&rsquo;s Story of it, which she
      imaginatively cast in the shape of an interview with Hewson. But worse
      than this, and really beyond the vagary of the wildest nightmare, she gave
      St. Johnswort as the scene of the apparition, with all the circumstances
      of the supposed burglary, while tastefully disguising Hewson&rsquo;s identity in
      the figure of A Well-Known Society-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Hewson read this Story (and it seemed to him that no means of
      bringing it to his notice at the club, and on the street, and by mail was
      left unemployed), he had two thoughts: one was of St. John, and one was of
      Miss Hernshaw. In all his exploitations of his experience he had
      carefully, he thought religiously, concealed the scene, except that one
      only time when Miss Hernshaw suddenly got it out of him by that demand of
      hers, &ldquo;Was it that morning at St. Johnswort when you got up so early and
      went for a cup of coffee at the inn?&rdquo; He had confided so absolutely in her
      that his admission had not troubled him at the time, and it had not
      troubled him since, till now when he found the fact given this hideous
      publicity, and knew that it could have become known only through her:
      through her who had seemed to make herself the protectress of his
      apparition and to guard it with indignation even against his own slight!
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not tell himself what to think of her, and in this disability he
      had at least the sad comfort of literally thinking nothing of her; but he
      could not keep his thoughts away from St. John. It appeared to him that he
      thought and lived nothing else till his dread concreted itself in the
      letter which came from St. John as soon as that fatal newspaper could
      reach him, and his demand for an explanation could come back to Hewson. He
      wrote from St. Johnswort, where he had already gone for the season, and he
      assumed, as no doubt he had a right to do, that the whole thing was a
      fake, and that if Hewson was hesitating about denying it for fear of
      giving it further prominence, or out of contempt for it, he wished that he
      would not hesitate. There were reasons, which would suggest themselves to
      Hewson, why the thing, if merely and entirely a fake, should be very
      annoying, and he thought that it would be best to make the denial
      immediate and imperative. To this end he advised Hewson&rsquo;s sending the
      newspaper people a lawyer&rsquo;s letter; with the ulterior trouble which this
      would intimate they would move in the matter with a quickened conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently St. John was very much in earnest, and Hewson would eagerly
      have lied out of it, he felt in sudden depravity, from a just regard for
      St. John&rsquo;s right to privacy in his own premises, but no lying, not the
      boldest, not the most ingenious, could now avail. Scores of people could
      witness that they had heard Hewson tell the story at first hand; at second
      hand hundreds could still more confidently affirm its truth. But if he
      admitted the truth of the fact and denied merely that it had happened at
      St. Johnswort, he would have Miss Hernshaw to deal with and what could he
      hope from truth so relentless as hers? She was of a moral make so awful
      that if he ventured to deny it without appeal for her support (which was
      impossible), she was quite capable of denying his denial.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did the only thing he could. He wrote to St. John declaring that the
      newspaper story, though utterly false in its pretensions to be an
      interview with him, was true in its essentials. The thing _had_ really
      happened, he _had_ seen an apparition, and he had seen it at St. Johnswort
      that morning when St. John supposed his house to have been invaded by
      burglars. He vainly turned over a thousand deprecatory expressions in his
      mind, with which to soften the blow but he let his letter go without
      including one. <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      X.
    </h3>
    <p>
      A week of silence passed, and then one night St. John himself appeared at
      Hewson&rsquo;s apartment. Hewson almost knew that it was his ring at the door,
      and in the tremulous note of his voice asking the man if he were at home,
      he recognized the great blubbery fellow&rsquo;s most plaintive mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Hewson,&rdquo; he whimpered, without staying for any form of greeting
      when they stood face to face, &ldquo;this has been a terrible business for me.
      You can&rsquo;t imagine how it&rsquo;s broken me up in every direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I--I&rsquo;m afraid I can, St. John,&rdquo; Hewson began, but St. John cut him off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, you can&rsquo;t. Look here!&rdquo; He showed a handful of letters. &ldquo;All from
      people who had promised to stay with me, taking it back, since that
      infernal interview of yours, or from people who hadn&rsquo;t answered before,
      saying they can&rsquo;t come. Of course they make all sorts of civil excuses. I
      shouldn&rsquo;t know what to do with these people if any of them came. There
      isn&rsquo;t a servant left on the place, except the gardener who lives in his
      own house, and the groom who sleeps in the stable. For the last three days
      I&rsquo;ve had to take my meals at that infernal inn where you got your coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it so bad as that?&rdquo; Hewson gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is. It&rsquo;s so bad that sometimes I can&rsquo;t realize it. Do you
      actually mean to tell me, Hewson that you saw a ghost in my house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said a ghost. I said an apparition. I don&rsquo;t know what it was. It
      may have been an optical delusion. I call it an apparition, because that&rsquo;s
      the shortest way out. You know I&rsquo;m not a spiritualist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the devil of it,&rdquo; said St. John. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very thing that
      makes people believe it _is_ a ghost. There isn&rsquo;t one of them that don&rsquo;t
      say to himself and the other fellows that if a cool, clear-headed chap
      like you saw something queer, it _must_ have been a ghost; and so they go
      on knocking my house down in price till I don&rsquo;t believe it would fetch
      fifteen hundred under the hammer to-morrow. It&rsquo;s simply ruin to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruin?&rdquo; Hewson echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ruin,&rdquo; St. John repeated. &ldquo;Before this thing came out I refused
      twenty-five thousand for the place, because I knew I could get
      twenty-eight thousand. Now I couldn&rsquo;t get twenty-eight hundred. Couldn&rsquo;t
      you understand that the reputation of being haunted simply plays the devil
      with a piece of property?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes; yes, I did understand that, and for that
      very reason I was always careful--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Careful! To tell people that you had seen a ghost in my house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! _Not_ to tell them where I had seen a ghost. I never--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did it get out then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; Hewson began, and then he stood with his mouth open, unable to close
      it for the articulation of the next word, which he at last huskily
      whispered forth, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell me?&rdquo; wailed St. John. &ldquo;Well, I call that pretty rough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is rough,&rdquo; Hewson admitted; &ldquo;and Heaven knows that I would make it
      smooth if I could. I never once--except once only--mentioned your place in
      connection with the matter. I was scrupulously careful not to do so, for I
      did imagine something like what has happened. I would do
      anything--anything--in reparation. But I can&rsquo;t even tell you how the name
      of your place got out in the connection, though certainly you have a right
      to ask and to know. The circumstances were--peculiar. The person-- was one
      that I wouldn&rsquo;t have dreamt was capable of repeating it. It was as if I
      had said the words over to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t understand all that,&rdquo; said St. John, with rueful sulkiness,
      from which he brisked up to ask, as if by a sudden inspiration, &ldquo;If it was
      only to one person, why couldn&rsquo;t you deny it, and throw the onus on the
      other fellow?&rdquo; He looked up at Hewson, standing nerveless before him, from
      where he lay mournfully wallowing in an easy-chair, as if now for the
      first time, there might be a gleam of hope for them both in some such
      notion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hewson slowly shook his head. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t work. The person--isn&rsquo;t that
      kind of person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, but see here,&rdquo; St. John urged. &ldquo;There must be something in the
      fellow that you can appeal to. If you went and told him how it was playing
      the very deuce with me pecuniarily, he would see the necessity of letting
      you deny it, and taking the consequences, if he was anything of a man at
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t anything of a man at all,&rdquo; said Hewson, in mechanical and
      melancholy parody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then in Heaven&rsquo;s name what is he?&rdquo; demanded St. John, savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; St. John fell back in his chair. But he pulled himself up
      again with a sudden renewal of hope. &ldquo;Why, see here! If she&rsquo;s the right
      kind of woman, she&rsquo;ll enjoy denying the story, and putting the people in
      the wrong that have circulated it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hewson shook his head in rejection of the general principle, while, as to
      the particular instance, he could only say: &ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t that kind. She&rsquo;s
      the kind that would rather die herself, and let everybody else die, than
      be party to any sort of deception.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be a queer woman,&rdquo; St. John bewailed himself, looking at the
      point of his cigar, and discovering to his surprise that it was out. He
      did not attempt to light it. &ldquo;Of course, I can&rsquo;t ask you _who_ she is; but
      why shouldn&rsquo;t I see her, and try what _I_ can do with her? I&rsquo;m the one
      that&rsquo;s the principal sufferer in this matter,&rdquo; he added, perhaps seeing
      refusal in Hewson&rsquo;s troubled eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because--for one reason--she&rsquo;s in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Lord!&rdquo; St. John lamented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if she were here in New York, I couldn&rsquo;t allow it,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;It
      was in confidence between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t seem to have thought so,&rdquo; said St. John, with sarcasm which
      Hewson could not resent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing for me to do,&rdquo; said Hewson, who had been thinking
      the point over, and saw no other way out for him as a gentleman, or even
      merely as a just man. He was not rich, and in the face of the mounting
      accumulations of other men he had grown comparatively poor, without
      actually losing money, since he had begun to lead the life which had long
      been his ideal. After carefully ascertaining at the time in question that
      he had sufficient income from inherited means to live without his
      profession, he had closed his law-office without shutting many clients
      out, and had contributed himself to the formation of a leisure class,
      which he conceived was regrettably lacking in our conditions. He had
      taste, he had reading, he had a pretty knowledge of the world from travel,
      he had observed manners, and it seemed to him that he might not immodestly
      pretend to supply, as far as one man went, a well-recognized want.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto he had been able to live up to his ideal with, sufficient
      satisfaction, and in proposing to himself never to marry, but to grow old
      gradually and gracefully as a bachelor of adequate income, he saw no
      difficulties in his way for the future, until this affair of the
      apparition. If now he incurred the chances of an open change in his way of
      living--the end was simply a question of very little time. He must not
      only declass, he must depatriate himself, for he would not have the means
      of living even much more economically than he now lived in New York, if he
      did what a sense of honor, of just responsibility urged him to do with
      regard to St. John.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have been glad of any interposition of Providence that would have
      availed him against his obvious duty. He would have liked to recall the
      words saying that there was only one thing for him to do, but he could not
      recall them and he was forced to go on. &ldquo;Will you sell me your place?&rdquo; he
      said to St. John, colorlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sell you my place? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply that if you will, I shall be glad to buy it at your own
      valuation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, look here, now, Hewson! I can&rsquo;t let you do this,&rdquo; St. John began,
      trying to feel a magnanimity which proved impossible to him. &ldquo;What do you
      want with my place? You couldn&rsquo;t get anybody to live there with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t afford to live there in any case,&rdquo; said Hewson; &ldquo;but I am
      entirely willing to risk the purchase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was it possible that Hewson knew something of the neighborhood or its
      future, which encouraged him to take the chances of the property
      appreciating in value? This thought passed through St. John&rsquo;s mind, and he
      was not the man to let himself be overreached in a deal. &ldquo;The place ought
      to be worth thirty thousand,&rdquo; he said, for a bluff.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a relief for Hewson to feel ashamed of St. John instead of himself,
      for a moment. &ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll give you thirty thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      St. John examined himself for a responsive generosity. The most he could
      say was, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing this because of what I&rsquo;d said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it matter? I make you a bonafide offer. I will give you thirty
      thousand dollars for St. Johnswort,&rdquo; said Hewson, haughtily. &ldquo;I ask you to
      sell me that place. I cannot see that it will ever be any good to me, but
      I can assure you that it would be a far worse burden for me to carry round
      the sense of having injured you, however unwillingly--God knows I never
      meant you harm!--than to shoulder the chance of your place remaining
      worthless on my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      St. John caught at the hope which the form of words suggested. &ldquo;If
      anything can bring it up, it will be the fact that you have bought it.
      Such a thing would give the lie to that ridiculous story, as nothing else
      could. Every one will see that a house can&rsquo;t be very badly haunted, if the
      man that the ghost appeared to is willing to buy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Hewson sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No perhaps about it,&rdquo; St. John retorted, all the more cheerfully because
      he would have been glad before this incident to take twenty thousand for
      his place. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just on the borders of Lenox, and it&rsquo;s bound to come up
      when this blows over.&rdquo; He talked on for a time in an encouraging strain,
      while Hewson, standing with his back against the mantel, looked absently
      down upon him. St. John was inwardly struggling through all to say that
      Hewson might have the property for twenty-eight thousand, but he could
      not. Possibly he made himself believe that he was letting it go a great
      bargain at thirty; at any rate he ended by saying, &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s yours--if
      you really mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean it,&rdquo; said Hewson.
    </p>
    <p>
      St. John floundered up out of his chair with seal-like struggles. &ldquo;Do you
      want the furniture?&rdquo; he panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The furniture? Yes, why not?&rdquo; said Hewson. He did not seem to know what
      he was saying, or to care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will put that in for a mere nominal consideration--the rugs alone are
      worth the money--say a thousand more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hewson&rsquo;s man came in with a note. &ldquo;The messenger is waiting, sir,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hewson was aware of wondering that he had not heard any ring. &ldquo;Will you
      excuse me?&rdquo; he said, toward St. John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; said St. John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hewson opened the note, and read it with an expression which can only be
      described as a radiant frown. He sat down at his desk, and wrote an answer
      to the note, and gave it to his man, who was still waiting. Then he said
      to St. John, &ldquo;What did you say the rugs were worth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take them. And what do you want for the rest of the furniture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clearly he had not understood that the furniture, rugs, and all, had been
      offered to him for a thousand dollars. But what was a man in St. John&rsquo;s
      place to do? As it was he was turning himself out of house and home for
      Hewson, and that was sacrifice enough. He hesitated, sighed deeply, and
      then said, &ldquo;Well, I will throw all that in for a couple of thousand more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Hewson, &ldquo;I will give it. Have the papers made out and I
      will have the money ready at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s no hurry about that, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said St. John,
      handsomely. <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      XI.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hewson&rsquo;s note was from Mrs. Rock, asking him to breakfast with her at the
      Walholland the next morning. She said that they were just off the steamer,
      which had got in late, and they had started so suddenly from London that
      she had not had time to write and have her apartment opened. She came to
      business in the last sentence where she said that Miss Hernshaw joined her
      in kind remembrances, and wished her to say that he must not fail them, or
      if he could not come to breakfast, to let them know at what hour during
      the day he would be kind enough to call; it was very important they should
      see him at the earliest possible moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hewson instantly decided that this summons was related to the affair of
      his apparition, without imagining how or why, and when Miss Hernshaw met
      him, and almost before she could say that Mrs. Rock would be down in a
      moment, began with it, he made no feint of having come for anything else.
    </p>
    <p class="ctr">
      <a href="images/illusp066.jpg"><img src="images/illusp066_th.jpg"
       alt="WHY, THERE ISN&rsquo;T ANY PUNISHMENT SEVERE ENOUGH FOR A CRIME LIKE THAT" /></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered the door of Mrs. Rock&rsquo;s parlor, where the breakfast table
      was laid, the girl came swiftly toward him, with the air of having turned
      from watching for him at the window. &ldquo;Well, what do you think of me?&rdquo; she
      demanded as soon as she had got over Mrs. Rock&rsquo;s excuses for having her
      receive him. He had of course to repeat, &ldquo;What do I think of you?&rdquo; but he
      knew perfectly what she meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      She disdained to help him pretend that he did not know. &ldquo;It was I who told
      that horrible woman about your experience at St. Johnswort. I didn&rsquo;t dream
      that she was an interviewer, but that doesn&rsquo;t excuse me, and I am willing
      to take any punishment for my--I don&rsquo;t know what to call it--mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was so intensely ready, so magnificently prepared for the stake, if
      that should be her sentence, that Hewson could not help laughing. &ldquo;Why
      there isn&rsquo;t any punishment severe enough for a crime like that,&rdquo; he began,
      but she would not allow him to trifle with the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t think you would be so uncandid! The instant I read that
      interview I made Mrs. Rock get ready to come. And we started the first
      steamer. It seemed to me that I could not eat or sleep, till I had seen
      you and told you what I had done and taken the consequences. And now do
      you think it right to turn it off as a joke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to make a joke of it,&rdquo; said Hewson, gravely, in compliance
      with her mood. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand, quite, how you could have got the
      story over there in time for you--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was cabled to their London edition--that&rsquo;s what it said in the paper;
      and by this time they must have it in Australia,&rdquo; said Miss Hernshaw, with
      unrelieved severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Hewson, giving himself time to realize that he was the
      psychical hero of two hemispheres. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he resumed &ldquo;what do you expect
      me to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I expect. I expected you to say something without my
      prompting you. You know that it was outrageous for me to talk about your
      apparition without your leave, and to be the means of its getting into the
      newspapers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure you were the means. I have told the story a hundred times,
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t excuse me. You knew the kind of people to tell it to,
      and I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am afraid I was willing to tell it to all kinds of people--to any
      kind that would listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are trying to evade me, Mr. Hewson,&rdquo; she said, with a severity he
      found charming. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect that of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The appeal was not lost upon Hewson. &ldquo;What do you want me to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you,&rdquo; said Miss Hernshaw, with an effect of giving him another
      trial, &ldquo;to say--to acknowledge that you were terribly annoyed by that
      interview.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will excuse me from attaching the slightest blame to you for it, I
      will acknowledge that I was annoyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hernshaw drew a deep breath as of relief. &ldquo;I will arrange about the
      blame,&rdquo; she said loftily. &ldquo;And now I wish to tell you how I never supposed
      that girl was an interviewer. We were all together at an artist&rsquo;s house in
      Rome, and after dinner, we got to telling ghost-stories, the way people
      do, around the fire, and I told mine--yours I mean. And before we broke
      up, this girl came to me--it was while we were putting on our wraps--and
      introduced herself, and said how much she had been impressed by my
      story--of course, I mean your story--and she said she supposed it was made
      up. I said I should not dream of making up a thing of that kind, and that
      it was every word true, and I had heard the person it happened to tell it
      himself. I don&rsquo;t know! I was vain of having heard it, so, at first hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can understand,&rdquo; said Hewson, sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then I told her who the person was, and where it happened--and about
      the burglary. You can&rsquo;t imagine how silly people get when they begin going
      in that direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I can,&rdquo; said Hewson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She seemed very grateful somehow; I couldn&rsquo;t see why, but I didn&rsquo;t ask;
      and then I didn&rsquo;t think about it again till I saw it in that awful
      newspaper. She sent it to me herself; she was such a simpleton; she
      thought I would actually like to see it. She must have written it down,
      and sent it to the paper, and they printed it when they got ready to; she
      needed the money, I suppose. Then I began to wonder what you would say,
      when you remembered how I blamed you for telling the same story--only not
      half so bad--at that dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always felt you were quite right,&rdquo; said Hewson. &ldquo;I have always thanked
      you in my own mind for being so frank with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what do you think now, when you know that I was ten times as
      bad as you--ten times as foolish and vulgar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had time to formulate my ideas yet,&rdquo; Hewson urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know perfectly well that you despise me. Can you say that I had any
      right to give your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have got out sooner or later. I never asked any one not to
      mention my name when I told the story--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that you think I took a liberty, and I did. But that&rsquo;s nothing.
      That isn&rsquo;t the point. How I do keep beating about the bush! Mrs. Rock says
      it was a great deal worse to tell where it happened, for that would give
      the place the reputation of being haunted and nobody could ever live there
      afterwards, for they couldn&rsquo;t keep servants, even if they didn&rsquo;t have the
      creeps themselves, and it would ruin the property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hewson had not been able, when she touched upon this point, to elude the
      keen eye with which she read his silent thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; oh, no,&rdquo; he began, but he could not frame in plausible terms the
      lies he would have uttered. He only succeeded in saying, &ldquo;Those things
      soon blow over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how,&rdquo; she said, sternly, &ldquo;does it happen that in every town and
      village, almost, there are houses that you can hardly hire anybody to live
      in, because people say they are haunted? No, Mr. Hewson, it&rsquo;s very kind of
      you, and I appreciate it, but you can&rsquo;t make me believe that it will ever
      blow over, about St. Johnswort. Have you heard from Mr. St. John since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Hewson was obliged to own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was he very much troubled about it? I should think he was a man that
      would be, from the way he behaved about the burglary. Was he?&rdquo; she
      persisted, seeing that Hewson hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I must say he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound of walking to and fro in the adjoining room, a quick
      shutting as of trunk-lids, a noise as of a skirt shaken out, and steps
      advanced to the door. Miss Hernshaw ran to it and turned the key in the
      lock. &ldquo;Not yet, Mrs. Rock,&rdquo; she called to the unseen presence within, and
      she explained to Hewson, as she faced him again, &ldquo;She promised that I
      should have it all out with you myself, and now I&rsquo;m not going to have her
      in here, interrupting. Well, did he write to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he wrote to me. He wanted me to deny the story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; said Hewson, with a note of indignation. &ldquo;It was true.
      Besides it wouldn&rsquo;t have been of any use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it would have been wicked and it would have been useless. And then
      what did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing? And you have never heard another word from him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he came to see me last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here in New York? Is he here yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe at the Overpark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hernshaw caught her breath, as if she were going to speak, but she
      did not say anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you insist upon all this, Miss Hernshaw?&rdquo; he entreated. &ldquo;It can do
      you no good to follow the matter up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I want to do myself _good?_&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;I want to do
      myself _harm!_ What did he say when he came to see you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can imagine,&rdquo; said Hewson, not able to keep out of his tone the
      lingering disgust he felt for St. John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He complained?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He all but shed tears,&rdquo; said Hewson, recalled to a humorous sense of St.
      John&rsquo;s behavior. &ldquo;I felt sorry for him; though,&rdquo; he added, darkly, &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t say that I do now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hernshaw didn&rsquo;t seek to fathom the mystery of his closing words. &ldquo;Had
      he been actually inconvenienced by that thing in the paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes--somewhat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Hewson groaned. &ldquo;If you must know--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must! The worst!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had fairly turned him out of house and home. His servants had all left
      him, and he had been reduced to taking his meals at the inn. He showed me
      a handful of letters from people whom he had asked to visit him,
      withdrawing their acceptances, or making excuses for not accepting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Miss Hernshaw, with a deep, inward breath, as if this now were
      indeed something like the punishment she had expected. &ldquo;And will it--did
      he think--did he say anything about the pecuniary effect--the--whether it
      would hurt the property?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seemed to think it would,&rdquo; answered Hewson, reluctantly, and he added,
      unfortunately for his generous purpose, &ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t enter upon that
      part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She arched her eyebrows in grieved surprise. &ldquo;But that is the very part
      that I want you to enter upon Mr. Hewson. You _must_ tell me, now! Did he
      say that it had injured the property very much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did, but--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think St. John is a man to put the worst face on that matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are saying that to keep me from feeling badly. But I ought to feel
      badly--I _wish_ to feel badly. I suppose he said that it wasn&rsquo;t worth
      anything now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something of that sort,&rdquo; Hewson helplessly admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then, I will buy it for whatever he chooses to ask!&rdquo; With the
      precipitation which characterized all her actions, Miss Hernshaw rose from
      the chair in which she had been provisionally sitting, pushed an electric
      button in the wall, swirled away to the other side of the room, unlocked
      the door behind which those sounds had subsided, and flinging it open,
      said, &ldquo;You can come out, Mrs. Hock; I&rsquo;ve rung for breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rock came smoothly forth, with her vague eyes wandering over every
      other object in the room, till they rested upon Hewson, directly before
      her. Then she gave him her hand, and asked, with a smile, as if taking him
      into the joke. &ldquo;Well, has Rosalie had it out with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had it out with him, Mrs. Rock,&rdquo; Miss Hernshaw answered, &ldquo;and I
      will tell you all about it later. Now I want my breakfast.&rdquo; <br /> <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      XII.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hewson ate the meal before him, and it was a very good one, as from time
      to time he noted, in a daze which was as strange a confusion of the two
      consciousnesses as he had ever experienced. Whatever the convention was
      between Miss Hernshaw and Mrs. Rock with regard to the matter in hand, or
      lately in hand, it dropped, after a few uninterested inquiries from Mrs.
      Rock, who was satisfied, or seemed so, to know that Miss Hernshaw had got
      at the worst. She led the talk to other things, like the comparative
      comforts and discomforts of the line to Genoa and the line to Liverpool;
      and Hewson met her upon these polite topics with an apparent fulness of
      interest that would have deceived a much more attentive listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the time he was arguing with Miss Hernshaw in his nether
      consciousness, pleading with her to keep her away from the fact that he
      had himself bought St. Johnswort, until he could frame some fitting form
      in which to tell her that he had bought it. With his outward eyes, he saw
      her drooping on the opposite side of the table, and in spite of her
      declaration that she wanted her breakfast, making nothing of it, after the
      preliminary melon, while to his inward vision she was passionately
      refusing, by every charming perversity, to be tempted away from the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Cunard boats always get in on Saturday, this morrow of their
      arrival was naturally Sunday; and after a while Hewson fancied symptoms of
      going to church in Mrs. Rock. She could not have become more vague than
      she ordinarily was, but her wanderings were of a kind of devotional
      character. She spoke of the American church in Rome, and asked Hewson if
      he knew the rector. Then, when he said he was afraid he was keeping her
      from going to church, she said she did not know whether Rosalie intended
      going. At the same time she rose from the table, and Hewson found that he
      should not be allowed to sit down again, unless by violence. He had to go
      away, and he went, as little at ease in his mind as he very well could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was no sooner out of the house than he felt the necessity of returning.
      He did not know how or when Miss Hernshaw would write to St. John, but
      that she would do so, he did not at all doubt, and then, when the truth
      came out, what would she think of him? He did not think her a very wise
      person; she seemed to him rather a wild and whirling person in her ideals
      of conduct, an unbridled and undisciplined person; and yet he was aware of
      profoundly and tenderly respecting her as a creature of the most
      inexpugnable innocence and final goodness. He could not bear to have her
      feel that he had trifled with her. There had not been many meetings
      between them, but each meeting had been of such event that it had advanced
      their acquaintance far beyond the point that it could have reached through
      weeks of ordinary association. From the first there had been that sort of
      intimacy which exists between spirits which encounter in the region of
      absolute sincerity. She had never used the least of those arts which women
      use in concealing the candor of their natures from men unworthy of it; she
      had not only practiced her rule of instant and constant veracity, but had
      avowed it, and as it were, invited his judgment of it. Hitherto, he had
      met her half-way at least, but now he was in the coil of a
      disingenuousness which must more and more trammel him from her, unless he
      found some way to declare the fact to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ought to have been an easy matter, but it was not easy; upon
      reflection it grew rather more difficult. Hewson did not see how he could
      avow the fact, which he wished to avow, without intolerable awkwardness;
      without the effect of boasting, without putting upon her a burden which he
      had no right to put. To be sure, she had got herself in for it all by her
      divine imprudence, but she had owned her error in that as promptly as if
      it had been the blame of some one else. Still Hewson doubted whether her
      magnanimity was large enough to go round in the case of a man who tried to
      let his magnanimity come upon her with any sort of dramatic surprise. This
      was what he must seem to be doing if he now left her to learn from another
      how he had kept St. John from loss by himself assuming the chance of
      depreciation in his property. But if he went and told her that he had done
      it, how much better for him would that be?
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a long, unhappy walk up into the Park, and then he walked back to
      the Walholland. By this time he thought Mrs. Rock and Miss Hernshaw must
      have been to church, but he had not the courage to send up his name to
      them. He waited about in the region of the dining-room, in the senseless
      hope that it would be better for him to surprise them on their way to
      luncheon, and trust to some chance for introducing his confession, than to
      seek a direct interview with Miss Hernshaw. But they did not come to
      luncheon, and then Hewson had the clerk send up his card. Word came back
      that the ladies would see him, and he followed the messenger to Mrs.
      Rock&rsquo;s apartment, where if he was surprised, he was not disappointed to be
      received by Miss Hernshaw alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Rock is lying down,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;but I thought that it might be
      something important, and you would not mind seeing me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Hewson, with what seemed to him afterwards superfluous
      politeness, and then they both waited until he could formulate his
      business, Miss Hernshaw drooping forward, and looking down in a way that
      he had found was most characteristic of her. &ldquo;It _is_ something
      important--at least it is important to me. Miss Hernshaw, may I ask
      whether you have done anything--it seems a very unwarrantable
      question--about St. Johnswort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About buying it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It will be useless to make any offer for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why will it be useless to do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because--because I have bought it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have bought it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; when he came to me last night, and made those representations--Well,
      in short, I have bought the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To save him from losing money by that--story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well--yes. I ought to have told you the fact this morning, as soon as you
      said you would buy the place. I know that you like people to be perfectly
      truthful. But--I couldn&rsquo;t--without seeming to--brag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Miss Hernshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took the risk of your writing to St. John; but then I realized that if
      he answered and told you what I ought to have told you myself, it would
      make it worse, and I came back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether it would have made it worse; but you have come too
      late,&rdquo; said Miss Hernshaw. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just written to Mr. St. John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were both silent for what Hewson thought a long time. At the end of
      it, he asked, &ldquo;Did you--you must excuse me--refer to me at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, certainly not. Why should I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know that it would have mattered.&rdquo; He was silent
      again, with bowed head; when he looked up he saw tears in the girl&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you know where this leaves me?&rdquo; she said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t pretend that I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Hewson. &ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can sell me the place for what it cost you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said Hewson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say that? It isn&rsquo;t as if I were poor; but even then you
      wouldn&rsquo;t have the right to refuse me if I insisted. It was my fault that
      it ever came out about St. Johnswort. It might have come out about you,
      but the harm to Mr. St. John--I did that, and why should you take it upon
      yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I was really to blame from the beginning to the end. If it had
      not been for my pitiful wish to shine as the confidant of mystery, nothing
      would have been known of the affair. Even when you asked me that night if
      it had not happened at St. Johnswort, I know now that I had a wretched
      triumph in saying that it had, and I was so full of this that I did not
      think to caution you against repeating what I had owned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the girl, with her unsparing honesty, &ldquo;if you had given me any
      hint, I would not have told for the world. Of course I did not think--a
      girl wouldn&rsquo;t--of the effect it would have on the property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you wouldn&rsquo;t think of that,&rdquo; said Hewson. Though he agreed with her,
      he would have preferred that she should continue to blame herself; but he
      took himself severely in hand again. &ldquo;So, you see, the fault was
      altogether mine, and if there is to be any penalty it ought to fall upon
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Hernshaw, &ldquo;and if there has been a fault there ought to
      be a penalty, don&rsquo;t you think? It would have been no penalty for me to buy
      St. Johnswort. My father wouldn&rsquo;t have minded it.&rdquo; She blushed suddenly,
      and added, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that--You may be so rich that--I think I had
      better stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said Hewson, amused, and glad of the relief. &ldquo;Go on. I will tell
      you anything you wish to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish, to know anything,&rdquo; said Miss Hernshaw, haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her words seemed to put an end to an interview for which there was no
      longer any excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hewson rose. &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; he said, and he was rather surprised at her
      putting out her hand, but he took it gratefully. &ldquo;Will you make my adieux
      to Mrs. Rock? And excuse my coming a second time to trouble you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you could have helped coming,&rdquo; said Miss Hernshaw, &ldquo;when
      you thought I might write to Mr. St. John at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether this implied excuse or greater blame, Hewson had to go away with
      it as her final response, and he went away certainly in as great
      discomfort as he had come. He did not feel quite well used; it seemed to
      him that hard measure had been dealt him on all sides, but especially by
      Miss Hernshaw. After her futile effort at reparation to St. John she had
      apparently withdrawn from all responsibility in the matter. He did not
      know when he was to see her again, if ever, and he did not know what he
      was to wait for, if anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he had the sense of waiting for something, or for some one, and he
      went home to wait. There he perceived that it was for St. John, who did
      not keep him waiting long. His nervous ring roused Hewson half an hour
      after his return, and St. John came in with a look in his greedy eyes
      which Hewson rightly interpreted at the first glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Hewson,&rdquo; St. John said, with his habitual lack of manners. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t want to get you in for this thing at St. Johnswort. I know why you
      offered to buy the place, and though of course you are the original cause
      of the trouble, I don&rsquo;t feel that it&rsquo;s quite fair to let you shoulder the
      consequences altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I been complaining?&rdquo; Hewson asked, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, and that&rsquo;s just it. You&rsquo;ve behaved like a little man through it all,
      and I don&rsquo;t like to take advantage of you. If you want to rue your
      bargain, I&rsquo;ll call it off. I&rsquo;ve had some fresh light on the matter, and I
      believe I can let you off without loss to myself. So that if it&rsquo;s me
      you&rsquo;re considering--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your fresh light?&rdquo; asked Hewson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said St. John, and he swallowed rather hard, as if it were a pill,
      &ldquo;the fact is, I&rsquo;ve had another offer for the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A better one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know that I can say that it is,&rdquo; answered St. John, saving
      his conscience in the form of the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hewson knew that he was lying, and he had no mercy on him. &ldquo;Then I believe
      I&rsquo;ll stick to my bargain. You say that the other party hasn&rsquo;t bettered my
      offer, and so I needn&rsquo;t withdraw on your account. I&rsquo;m not bound to
      withdraw for any other reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo; St. John rubbed his chin, as if hesitating to eat his
      words, however unpalatable; but in the end he seemed not to find it
      possible. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, disgustedly, as he floundered up to take his
      leave, &ldquo;I thought I ought to come and give you the chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very nice of you,&rdquo; said Hewson, with a smile that made itself a
      derisive grin in spite of him, and a laugh of triumph when the door had
      closed upon St. John. <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      XIII.
    </h3>
    <p>
      After the first flush of Hewson&rsquo;s triumph had passed he began to enjoy it
      less, and by-and-by he did not enjoy it at all. He had done right not only
      in keeping St. John from plundering Miss Hernshaw, but in standing firm
      and taking the punishment which ought to fall upon him and not on her. But
      the sense of having done right sufficed him no more than the sense of
      having got the better of St. John. What was lacking to him? In the
      casuistry of the moment, which was perhaps rather emotional than rational,
      it appeared to Hewson that he had again a duty toward Miss Hernshaw, and
      that his feeling of dissatisfaction was the first effect of its
      non-fulfilment. But it was clearly impossible that he should go again to
      see her, and tell her what had passed between him and St. John, and it was
      clearly impossible that he should write and tell her what it was quite as
      clearly her right to know from him. If he went to her, or wrote to her, he
      felt himself in danger of wanting to shine in the affair, as her protector
      against the rapacity of St. John, and as the man of superior quality who
      had outwitted a greedy fellow. The fear that she might not admire his
      splendor in either sort caused him to fall somewhat nervelessly back upon
      Providence; but if the moral government of the universe finally favored
      him it was not by traversing any of its own laws. By the time he had
      determined to achieve both the impossibilities which formed his
      dilemma--had decided to write to Miss Hernshaw and call upon her, and
      leave his letter in the event of failing to find her--his problem was as
      far solved as it might be, by the arrival of a note from Miss Hernshaw
      herself, hoping that he would come to see her on business of pressing
      importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She received him without any pretence of Mrs. Rock&rsquo;s intermediary
      presence, and put before him a letter which she had received, before
      writing him, from St. John, and which she could not answer without first
      submitting it to him. It was a sufficiently straightforward expression of
      his regret that he could not accept her very generous offer for St.
      Johnswort because the place was already sold. He had the taste to forbear
      any allusion to the motives which (she told Hewson) she had said prompted
      her offer; but then he became very darkling and sinuous in a suggestion
      that if Miss Hernshaw wished to have her offer known as hers to the
      purchaser of St. Johnswort he would be happy to notify him of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she eagerly commented to Hewson, &ldquo;he does not give your name;
      but I know who it is, though I did not know when I made him my offer. I
      must answer his letter now, and what shall I say? Shall I tell him I know
      who it is? I should like to; I hate all concealments! Will it do any harm
      to tell him I know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hewson reflected. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how it can. I was trying to come to you,
      when I got your note, to say that St. John had been to see me, and offered
      to release me from my offer, because, as I thought, you had made him a
      better one. He&rsquo;s amusingly rapacious, St. John is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you--I beg your pardon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not at all. I said I would stand to my offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She repressed, apparently, some form of protest, and presently asked, &ldquo;And
      what shall I say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you like, that you have learned who the purchaser of St. Johnswort
      is, and that you know he will not give way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she said, with a quick sigh, as of disappointment. After an
      indefinite pause, she asked, &ldquo;Shall you be going to St. Johnswort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Hewson answered. &ldquo;I had thought of going to Europe.
      But, yes, I think I shall go to St. Johnswort, first, at any rate. One
      can&rsquo;t simply turn one&rsquo;s back on a piece of real estate in that way,&rdquo; he
      said, recognizing a fact that would doubtless have presented itself in due
      order for his consideration. &ldquo;My one notion was to forget it as quickly as
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not think you would want to do that,&rdquo; said the girl, seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, one oughtn&rsquo;t to neglect an investment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that. But if such a thing had happened to me, there, I
      should want to go again and again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the apparition? Did I tell you how I had always had the
      expectation that I should see it again, and perhaps understand it? But
      when I had behaved so shabbily about it, I began to feel that it would not
      come again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were in your place,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;I should never give up; I
      should spend my whole life trying to find out what it meant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;I wish you could put yourself in my place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could,&rdquo; she returned, intensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked into each other&rsquo;s faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Hernshaw,&rdquo; he demanded, solemnly, &ldquo;do you really like people to say
      what they think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I wish you would come to St. Johnswort with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would that do?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;If Mrs. Rock--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw how far she was from taking his meaning, but he pushed on. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      want Mrs. Rock. I want you--you alone. Don&rsquo;t you understand me? I love
      you. I--of course it&rsquo;s ridiculous! We&rsquo;ve only met three or four times in
      our lives, but I knew this as well the first moment as I do now. I knew it
      when you came walking across the garden that morning, and I haven&rsquo;t known
      it any better since, and I couldn&rsquo;t in a thousand years. But of course--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; she said, wafting herself into a chair, and he obeyed her. &ldquo;I
      should have to tell my father,&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certainly,&rdquo; and he sprang to his feet again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She commanded him to his chair with an imperative gesture. &ldquo;I have got to
      find out what I think, first, myself. If I were sure that I loved you--but
      I don&rsquo;t know. I believe you are good. I believed that when they were all
      joking you there at breakfast, and you took it so nicely; I have _always_
      believed that you were good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to be appealing to him for confirmation, but he could not very
      well say that she was right, and he kept silent. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like your
      telling that story at the dinner, and I said so; and then I went and did
      the same thing, or worse; so that I have nothing to say about that. And I
      think you have behaved very nobly to Mr. St. John.&rdquo; As if at some sign of
      protest in Hewson, she insisted, &ldquo;Yes, I do! But all this doesn&rsquo;t prove
      that I love you.&rdquo; Again she seemed to appeal to him, and this time he
      thought he might answer her appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t prove that _I_ love _you_, but I feel sure of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you believe that we ought to take our feelings for a guide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what people do,&rdquo; he ventured, with the glimmer of a smile in his
      eyes, which she was fixing so earnestly with her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not satisfied that it is the right way,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;If there is
      really such a thing as love there ought to be some way of finding it out
      besides our feelings. Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s a thing we ought to talk
      sensibly about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all things in the world; though it isn&rsquo;t the custom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hernshaw was silent for a moment. Then she said, &ldquo;I believe I should
      like a little time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t expect you to answer me at once,--I&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you are going to Europe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t go to Europe at all. I can go to St. Johnswort, and wait for
      your answer there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be a good while,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;I should want to tell my father
      that I was thinking about it, and he would want to see you before he
      approved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;that it would make any difference, if I was sure of it
      myself. He has always said that he would not try to control me in such a
      matter, and I think he would like you. I do like you very much myself, Mr.
      Hewson, but I don&rsquo;t think it would be right to say I loved you unless I
      could prove it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hewson was tempted to say that she could prove it by marrying him, but he
      had not the heart to mock a scruple which he felt to be sacred. What he
      did say was: &ldquo;Then I will wait till you can prove it. Do you wish me not
      to see you again, before you have made up your mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t see what harm there would be in our meeting.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,
      I can&rsquo;t, either,&rdquo; said Hewson, as she seemed to refer the point to him.
      &ldquo;Should you mind my coming again, say, this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night?&rdquo; She reflected a moment. &ldquo;Yes, come to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he came after dinner, Hewson was sensible from the perfect
      unconsciousness of Mrs. Rock&rsquo;s manner that Miss Hernshaw had been telling
      her. Her habit of a wandering eye, contributed to the effect she wished to
      produce, if this were the effect, and her success was such that it might
      easily have deceived herself. But when Mrs. Rock, in a supreme exercise of
      her unconsciousness, left him with the girl for a brief interval before it
      was time for him to go, Miss Hernshaw said, &ldquo;Mrs. Rock knows about it, and
      she says that the best way for me to find out will be to try whether I can
      live without you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that Mrs. Rock&rsquo;s idea?&rdquo; asked Hewson, as gravely as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No it was mine; I suggested it to her; but she approves of it. Don&rsquo;t you
      like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I hope I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t die while you are trying to live without me. Shall
      you be very long?&rdquo; She frowned, and he hastened to say, &ldquo;I do like your
      idea; it&rsquo;s the best way, and I thank you for giving me a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going out to my father&rsquo;s ranch in Colorado, at once,&rdquo; she
      explained. &ldquo;We shall start to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! May I come to see you off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I would rather begin at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I write to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will write to you--when I&rsquo;ve decided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave him her hand, but she would not allow him to keep it for more
      than farewell, and then she made him stay till Mrs. Rock came back, and
      take leave of her too; he had frankly forgotten Mrs. Rock, who bade him
      adieu with averted eyes, and many civilities about seeing him again. She
      could hardly have been said to be seeing him then. <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      XIV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The difficulties of domestication at St. Johnswort had not been
      misrepresented by the late proprietor, Hewson found, when he went to take
      possession of his estate. He thought it right in engaging servants to say
      openly that the place had the reputation of being haunted, and if he had
      not thought it right he would have thought it expedient, for he knew that
      if he had concealed the fact it would have been discovered to them within
      twenty-four hours of their arrival. His declaration was sufficient at once
      with most, who recoiled from his service as if he had himself been a
      ghost; with one or two sceptics who seemed willing to take the risks
      (probably in a guilty consciousness of records that would have kept them
      out of other employ) his confession that he had himself seen the spectre
      which haunted St. Johnswort, was equally effective. He prevailed at last
      against the fact and his own testimony with a Japanese, who could not be
      made to understand the objection to the place, and who willingly went with
      Hewson as his valet and general house-workman. With the wife of the
      gardener coming in to cook for them during the long daylight, he got on in
      as much comfort as he could have expected, and by night he suffered no
      sort of disturbance from the apparition. He had expected to be annoyed by
      believers in spiritualism, and other psychical inquirers, but it sufficed
      with them to learn from him that he had come to regard his experience, of
      which he had no more question now than ever, as purely subjective.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Hewson, in the six weeks&rsquo; time which he spent at St.
      Johnswort, waiting to hear from Rosalie (he had come already to think of
      her as Rosalie), that all his life was subjective, it passed so like a
      dream. He had some outward cares as to the place; he kept a horse in the
      stable, where St. John had kept half a dozen, and he had the gardener look
      after that as well as the shrubs and vegetables; but all went on in a
      suspensive and provisional sort. In the mean time Rosalie&rsquo;s charm grew
      upon him; everything that she had said or looked, was hourly and daily
      sweeter and dearer; her truth was intoxicating, beyond the lures of other
      women, in which the quality of deceit had once fascinated him. Now, so
      late in his youthful life, he realized that there was no beauty but that
      of truth, and he pledged himself a thousand times that if she should say
      she could not live without him he would henceforward live for truth alone,
      and not for the truth merely as it was in her, but as it was in
      everything. In those day&rsquo;s he learned to know himself, as he never had
      before, and to put off a certain shell of worldliness that had grown upon
      him. In his remoteness from it, New York became very distasteful to him;
      he thought with reluctance of going back to it; his club, which had been
      his home, now appeared a joyless exile; the life of a leisure class, which
      he had made his ideal, looked pitifully mean and little in the retrospect;
      he wondered how he could have valued the things that he had once thought
      worthy. He did not know what he should replace it all with, but Rosalie
      would know, in the event of not being able to live without him. In that
      event there was hardly any use of which he could not be capable. In any
      other event--he surprised himself by realizing that in any other
      event--still the universe had somehow more meaning than it once had.
      Somehow, he felt himself an emancipated man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began many letters to Rosalie, and some he finished and some not, but
      he sent none; and when her letter came at last, he was glad that he had
      waited for it in implicit trust of its coming, though he believed she
      would have forgiven him if he had not had the patience. The letter was
      quite what he could have imagined of her. She said that she had put
      herself thoroughly to the test, and she could not live without him. But if
      he had found out that he could live without her, then she should know that
      she had been to blame, and would take her punishment. Apparently in her
      philosophy, which now seemed to him so divine, without punishment there
      must be perdition; it was the penalty that redeemed; that was the token of
      forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hewson hurried out to Colorado, where he found Hernshaw a stout, silent,
      impersonal man, whose notion of the paternal office seemed to be a ready
      acquiescence in a daughter&rsquo;s choice of a husband; he appeared to think
      this could be best expressed to Hewson in a good cigar He perceptibly
      enjoyed the business details of the affair, but he enjoyed despatching
      them in the least possible time and the fewest words, and then he settled
      down to the pleasure of a superficial passivity. Hewson could not make out
      that he regarded his daughter as at all an unusual girl, and from this he
      argued that her mother must have been a very unusual woman. His only
      reason for doubting that Rosalie must have got all her originality from
      her mother was something that fell from Hernshaw when they were near the
      end of their cigars. He said irrelevantly to their talk at that point, &ldquo;I
      suppose you know Rosalie believes in that ghost of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it a ghost?--I&rsquo;ve never been sure, myself,&rdquo; said Hewson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you explain it?&rdquo; asked his prospective father-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t explain it. I have always left it just as it was. I know that it
      was a real experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I should have left it so, too,&rdquo; said Hernshaw. &ldquo;That always gives
      it a chance to explain itself. If such a thing had happened to me I should
      give it all the time it wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t hurried it,&rdquo; Hewson suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I mean,&rdquo; and Hernshaw stepped to the edge of the porch and threw the
      butt of his cigar into the darkness, where it described a glimmering arc,
      &ldquo;is that if anything came to me that would help shore up my professed
      faith in what most of us want to believe in, I would take the common-law
      view of it. I would believe it was innocent till it proved itself guilty.
      I wouldn&rsquo;t try to make it out a fraud myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve really done,&rdquo; said Hewson. &ldquo;But before people
      I&rsquo;ve put up a bluff of despising it.&rdquo;
 </p>
    <p>
     &ldquo;Oh, yes, I understand that,&rdquo; said
      Hernshaw. &ldquo;A man thinks that if he can have an experience like that he
      must be something out of the common, and if he can despise it--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hit my case exactly,&rdquo; said Hewson, and the two men laughed. <br />
      <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      XV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      After his marriage, which took place without needless delay, Hewson
      returned with his wife to spend their honey-moon at St. Johnswort. The
      honey-moon prolonged itself during an entire year, and in this time they
      contrived so far to live down its reputation of being a haunted house that
      they were able to conduct their _ménage_ on the ordinary terms. They
      themselves never wished to lose the sense of something supernatural in the
      place, and were never quite able to accept the actual conditions as final.
      That is to say, Rosalie was not, for she had taken Hewson&rsquo;s apparition
      under her peculiar care, and defended it against even his question. She
      had a feeling (it was scarcely a conviction) that if he believed more
      strenuously in the validity of his apparition as an authorized messenger
      from the unseen world it would yet come again and declare its errand. She
      could not accept the theory that if such a thing actually happened it
      could happen for nothing at all, or that the reason of its occurrence
      could be indefinitely postponed. She was impatient of that, as often as he
      urged the possibility, and she wished him to use a seriousness of mind in
      speaking of his apparition which should form some sort of atonement to it
      for his past levity, though since she had taken his apparition into her
      keeping he had scarcely hazarded any suggestion concerning it; in fact it
      had become so much her apparition that he had a fantastic reluctance from
      meddling with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are always requiring a great occasion for it,&rdquo; he said, at last.
      &ldquo;What greater event could it have foreshadowed or foreshown, than that
      which actually came to pass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, Arthur,&rdquo; she said, letting her hand creep into
      his, where it trembled provisionally as they sat together in the twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that was the day I first saw you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you are laughing!&rdquo; she said, pulling her hand away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I&rsquo;m not! I couldn&rsquo;t imagine anything more important than the
      union of our lives. And if that was what the apparition meant to portend
      it could not have intimated it by a more noble and impressive behavior.
      Simply to be there, and then to be gone, and leave the rest to us! It was
      majestic, it was--delicate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was. But it was too much, for it was out of proportion. A mere
      earthly love-affair--&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it merely for earth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, husband, I hope you don&rsquo;t think so! I wanted you to say you didn&rsquo;t.
      And if you don&rsquo;t think so, yes, I&rsquo;ll believe it came for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be sure I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I know it will come again.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> <br />

      &ldquo;All that sort of personification,&rdquo; said Wanhope, &ldquo;is far less remarkable
      than the depersonification which has now taken place so thoroughly that we
      no longer think in the old terms at all. It was natural that the primitive
      peoples should figure the passions, conditions, virtues, vices, forces,
      qualities, in some sort of corporal shape, with each a propensity or
      impulse of its own, but it does not seem to me so natural that the
      derivative peoples should cease to do so. It is rational that they should
      do so, and I don&rsquo;t know that any stronger proof of our intellectual
      advance could be alleged than the fact that the old personifications
      survive in the parlance while they are quite extinct in the consciousness.
      We still talk of death at times as if it were an embodied force of some
      kind, and of love in the same way; but I don&rsquo;t believe that any man of the
      commonest common-school education thinks of them so. If you try to do it
      yourself, you are rather ashamed of the puerility, and when a painter or a
      sculptor puts them in an objective shape, you follow him with impatience,
      almost with contempt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the poets?&rdquo; asked Minver, less with the notion, perhaps, of
      refuting the psychologist than of bringing the literary member of our
      little group under the disgrace that had fallen upon him as an artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poets,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;are as extinct as the personifications.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Yes, get down to business,&rdquo; said Rulledge. Being of no employ whatever,
      and spending his whole life at the club in an extraordinary idleness,
      Rulledge was always using the most strenuous expressions, and requiring
      everybody to be practical. He leaned directly forward with the difficulty
      that a man of his girth has in such a movement, and vigorously broke off
      the ash of his cigar against the edge of his saucer. We had been dining
      together, and had been served with coffee in the Turkish room, as it was
      called from its cushions and hangings of Indian and Egyptian stuffs. &ldquo;What
      is the instance you&rsquo;ve got up your sleeve?&rdquo; He smoked with great energy,
      and cast his eyes alertly about as if to make sure that there was no
      chance of Wanhope&rsquo;s physically escaping him, from the corner of the divan,
      where he sat pretty well hemmed in by the rest of us, spreading in an
      irregular circle before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You unscientific people are always wanting an instance, as if an instance
      were convincing. An instance is only suggestive; a thousand instances, if
      you please, are convincing,&rdquo; said the psychologist. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know that
      I wish to be convincing. I would rather be enquiring. That is much more
      interesting, and, perhaps, profitable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; Minver persisted, apparently in behalf of Rulledge, but
      with an after-grudge of his own, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll allow that you were thinking of
      something in particular when you began with that generalization about the
      lost art of personifying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is very curious,&rdquo; said the psychologist. &ldquo;We talk of
      generalizing, but is there any such thing? Aren&rsquo;t we always striving from
      one concrete to another, and isn&rsquo;t what we call generalizing merely a
      process of finding our way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see what you mean,&rdquo; said the artist, expressing in that familiar
      formula the state of the man who hopes to know what the other man means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say,&rdquo; Rulledge put in. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got something up your
      sleeve. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wanhope struck the little bell on the table before him, but, without
      waiting for a response, he intercepted a waiter who was passing with a
      coffee-pot, and asked, &ldquo;Oh, couldn&rsquo;t you give me some of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man filled his cup for him, and after Wanhope put in the sugar and
      lifted it to his lips, Rulledge said, with his impetuous business air,
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to see what Wanhope does his high thinking on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the psychologist admitted, &ldquo;coffee is an inspiration. But you can
      overdo an inspiration. It would be interesting to know whether there
      hasn&rsquo;t been a change in the quality of thought since the use of such
      stimulants came in--whether it hasn&rsquo;t been subtilized--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that what you were going to say?&rdquo; demanded Rulledge, relentlessly.
      &ldquo;Come, we&rsquo;ve got no time to throw away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;_You_ haven&rsquo;t, anyway,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, none of his own,&rdquo; Minver admitted for the idler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you mean I have thrown it all away. Well, I don&rsquo;t want to throw
      away other peoples&rsquo;. Go on, Wanhope.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The psychologist set his cup down and resumed his cigar, which he had to
      pull at pretty strongly before it revived. &ldquo;I should not be surprised,&rdquo; he
      began, &ldquo;if a good deal of the fear of death had arisen, and perpetuated
      itself in the race, from the early personification of dissolution as an
      enemy of a certain dreadful aspect, armed and threatening. That conception
      wouldn&rsquo;t have been found in men&rsquo;s minds at first; it would have been the
      result of later crude meditation upon the fact. But it would have remained
      through all the imaginative ages, and the notion might have been
      intensified in the more delicate temperaments as time went on, and by the
      play of heredity it might come down to our own day in certain instances
      with a force scarcely impaired by the lapse of incalculable time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said just now,&rdquo; said Rulledge, in rueful reproach, &ldquo;that
      personification had gone out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it has. I did say that, and yet I suppose that though such a notion
      of death, say, no longer survives in the consciousness, it does survive in
      the unconsciousness, and that any vivid accident or illusory suggestion
      would have force to bring it to the surface.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I knew what you were driving at,&rdquo; said Rulledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember Ormond, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Wanhope, turning suddenly to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I--he isn&rsquo;t living, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he died two years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; I said, with the relief that one feels in not having put a
      fellow-creature out of life, even conditionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew Mrs. Ormond, too, I believe,&rdquo; the psychologist pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      I owned that I used to go to the Ormonds&rsquo; house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know what a type she was, I suppose,&rdquo; he turned to the others,
      &ldquo;and as they&rsquo;re both dead it&rsquo;s no contravention of the club etiquette
      against talking of women, to speak of her. I can&rsquo;t very well give the
      instance--the sign--that Rulledge is seeking without speaking of her,
      unless I use a great deal of circumlocution.&rdquo; We all urged him to go on,
      and he went on. &ldquo;I had the facts I&rsquo;m going to give, from Mrs. Ormond. You
      know that the Ormonds left New York a couple of years ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He happened to look at Minver as he spoke, and Minver answered: &ldquo;No; I
      must confess that I didn&rsquo;t even know they had left the planet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wanhope ignored his irrelevant ignorance. &ldquo;They went to live provisionally
      at a place up the Housatonic road, somewhere--perhaps Canaan; but it
      doesn&rsquo;t matter. Ormond had been suffering some time with an obscure
      affection of the heart--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come now!&rdquo; said Rulledge. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to spring anything so pat
      as heart-disease on us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Acton is all ears,&rdquo; said Minver, nodding toward me. &ldquo;He hears the weird
      note afar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The psychologist smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re not interested. I&rsquo;m not much
      interested myself in these unrelated instances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; &ldquo;Do go on!&rdquo; the different entreaties came, and after a
      little time taken to recover his lost equanimity, Wanhope went on: &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know whether you knew that Ormond had rather a peculiar dread of
      death.&rdquo; We none of us could affirm that we did, and again Wanhope resumed:
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t say that he was a coward above other men I believe he was
      rather below the average in cowardice. But the thought of death weighed
      upon him. You find this much more commonly among the Russians, if we are
      to believe their novelists, than among Americans. He might have been a
      character out of one of Tourguénief&rsquo;s books, the idea of death was so
      constantly present with him. He once told me that the fear of it was a
      part of his earliest consciousness, before the time when he could have had
      any intellectual conception of it. It seemed to be something like the
      projection of an alien horror into his life--a prenatal influence--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jove!&rdquo; Rulledge broke in. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how the women stand it. To look
      forward nearly a whole year to death as the possible end of all they&rsquo;re
      hoping for and suffering for! Talk of men&rsquo;s courage after that! I wonder
      we&rsquo;re not _all_ marked.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard of anything of the kind in Ormond&rsquo;s history,&rdquo; said Wanhope,
      tolerant of the incursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minver took his cigar out to ask, the more impressively, perhaps, &ldquo;What do
      you fellows make of the terror that a two months&rsquo; babe starts in its sleep
      with before it can have any notion of what fear is on its own hook?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t make anything of it,&rdquo; the psychologist answered. &ldquo;Perhaps the
      pathologists do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s easy enough to say wind,&rdquo; Rulledge indignantly protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too easy, I agree with you,&rdquo; Wanhope consented. &ldquo;We cannot tell what
      influences reach us from our environment, or what our environment really
      is, or how much or little we mean by the word. The sense of danger seems
      to be inborn, and possibly it is a survival of our race life when it was
      wholly animal and took care of itself through what we used to call the
      instincts. But, as I was saying, it was not danger that Ormond seemed to
      be afraid of, if it came short of death. He was almost abnormally
      indifferent to pain. I knew of his undergoing an operation that most
      people would take ether for, and not wincing, because it was not supposed
      to involve a fatal result.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he carried his own anodyne with him,&rdquo; said Minver, &ldquo;like the
      Chinese.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean a sort of self-anaesthesia?&rdquo; Wanhope asked. &ldquo;That is very
      interesting. How far such a principle, if there is one, can be carried in
      practice. The hypnotists--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I didn&rsquo;t mean anything so serious or scientific,&rdquo; said the
      painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t switch Wanhope off on a side track,&rdquo; Rulledge implored. &ldquo;You
      know how hard it is to keep him on the main line. He&rsquo;s got a mind that
      splays all over the place if you give him the least chance. Now, Wanhope,
      come down to business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wanhope laughed amiably. &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s so very little of the business. I&rsquo;m
      not sure that it wasn&rsquo;t Mrs. Ormond&rsquo;s attitude toward the fact that
      interested me most. It was nothing short of devout. She was a convert. She
      believed he really saw--I suppose,&rdquo; he turned to me, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no harm in
      our recognizing now that they didn&rsquo;t always get on smoothly together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they ever?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes--oh, yes,&rdquo; said the psychologist, kindly. &ldquo;They were very fond of
      each other, and often very peaceful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never happened to be by,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Used to fight like cats and dogs,&rdquo; said Minver. &ldquo;And they didn&rsquo;t seem to
      mind people. It was very swell, in a way, their indifference, and it did
      help to take away a fellow&rsquo;s embarrassment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That seemed to come mostly to an end that summer,&rdquo; said Wanhope, &ldquo;if you
      could believe Mrs. Ormond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You probably couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the painter put in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate she seemed to worship his memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; she hadn&rsquo;t him there to claw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she was quite frank about it with me,&rdquo; the psychologist pursued.
      &ldquo;She admitted that they had always quarreled a good deal. She seemed to
      think it was a token of their perfect unity. It was as if they were each
      quarreling with themselves, she said. I&rsquo;m not sure that there wasn&rsquo;t
      something in the notion. There is no doubt but that they were tremendously
      in love with each other, and there is something curious in the bickerings
      of married people if they are in love. It&rsquo;s one way of having no
      concealments; it&rsquo;s perfect confidence of a kind--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or unkind,&rdquo; Minver suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has all that got to do with it!&rdquo; Rulledge demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing directly,&rdquo; Wanhope confessed, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m not sure that it has much
      to do indirectly. Still, it has a certain atmospheric relation. It is very
      remarkable how thoughts connect themselves with one another. It&rsquo;s a sort
      of wireless telegraphy. They do not touch at all; there is apparently no
      manner of tie between them, but they communicate--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; Rulledge fumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wanhope looked at him with a smiling concern, such as a physician might
      feel in the symptoms of a peculiar case. &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said absently,
      &ldquo;how much of our impatience with a fact delayed is a survival of the
      childhood of the race, and how far it is the effect of conditions in which
      possession is the ideal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rulledge pushed back his chair, and walked away in dudgeon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a busy
      man myself. When you&rsquo;ve got anything to say you can send for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Minver ran after him, as no doubt he meant some one should. &ldquo;Oh, come
      back! He&rsquo;s just going to begin;&rdquo; and when Rulledge, after some pouting,
      had been _pushed down into his chair again,_ Wanhope went on, with a
      glance of scientific pleasure at him. <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house they had taken was rather a lonely place, out of sight of
      neighbors, which they had got cheap because it was so isolated and
      inconvenient, I fancy. Of course Mrs. Ormond, with her exaggeration,
      represented it as a sort of solitude which nobody but tramps of the most
      dangerous description ever visited. As she said, she never went to sleep
      without expecting to wake up murdered in her bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like her,&rdquo; said Minver, with a glance at me full of relish for the touch
      of character which I would feel with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said,&rdquo; Wanhope went on, &ldquo;that she was anxious from the first for the
      effect upon Ormond. In the stress of any danger, she gave me to
      understand, he always behaved very well, but out of its immediate presence
      he was full of all sorts of gloomy apprehensions, unless the surroundings
      were cheerful. She could not imagine how he came to take the place, but
      when she told him so--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt she told him so pretty promptly,&rdquo; the painter grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;--he explained that he had seen it on a brilliant day in spring, when all
      the trees were in bloom, and the bees humming in the blossoms, and the
      orioles singing, and the outlook from the lawn down over the river valley
      was at its best. He had fallen in love with the place, that was the truth,
      and he was so wildly in love with it all through that he could not feel
      the defect she did in it. He used to go gaily about the wide, harking old
      house at night, shutting it up, and singing or whistling while she sat
      quaking at the notion of their loneliness and their absolute
      helplessness--an invalid and a little woman--in case anything happened.
      She wanted him to get the man who did the odd jobs about the house, to
      sleep there, but he laughed at her, and they kept on with their usual town
      equipment of two serving-women. She could not account for his spirits,
      which were usually so low when they were alone--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not fighting,&rdquo; Minver suggested to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;--and when she asked him what the matter was he could not account for
      them, either. But he said, one day, that the fear of death seemed to be
      lifted from his soul, and that made her shudder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rulledge fetched a long sigh, and Minver interpreted, &ldquo;Beginning to feel
      that it&rsquo;s something like now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said that for the first time within his memory he was rid of that
      nether consciousness of mortality which had haunted his whole life, and
      poisoned, more or less, all his pleasure in living. He had got a reprieve,
      or a respite, and he felt like a boy--another kind of boy from what he had
      ever been. He was full of all sorts of brilliant hopes and plans. He had
      visions of success in business beyond anything he had known, and talked of
      buying the place he had taken, and getting a summer colony of friends
      about them. He meant to cut the property up, and make the right kind of
      people inducements. His world seemed to have been emptied of all trouble
      as well as all mortal danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you psychologists some message about a condition like that!&rdquo; I
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s only the pathologists again,&rdquo; said Minver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The alienists, rather more specifically,&rdquo; said Wanhope. &ldquo;They recognize
      it as one of the beginnings of insanit--_folie des grandeurs_ as the
      French call the stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it necessarily that?&rdquo; Rulledge demanded, with a resentment which we
      felt so droll in him that we laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it is,&rdquo; said Wanhope. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why we shouldn&rsquo;t
      sometimes, in the absence of proofs to the contrary, give such a fact the
      chance to evince a spiritual import. Of course it had no other import to
      poor Mrs. Ormond, and of course I didn&rsquo;t dream of suggesting a scientific
      significance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not!&rdquo; Rulledge puffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wanhope went on: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should have dared to do so to a woman in
      her exaltation concerning it. I could see that however his state had
      affected her with dread or discomfort in the first place, it had since
      come to be her supreme hope and consolation. In view of what afterward
      happened, she regarded it as the effect of a mystical intimation from
      another world that was sacred, and could not he considered like an
      ordinary fact without sacrilege. There was something very pathetic in her
      absolute conviction that Ormond&rsquo;s happiness was an emanation from the
      source of all happiness, such as sometimes, where the consciousness
      persists, comes to a death-bed. That the dying are not afraid of dying is
      a fact of such common, such almost invariable observation--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; I interposed, &ldquo;when the vital forces are beaten so low that
      the natural dread of ceasing to be, has no play? It has less play, I&rsquo;ve
      noticed, in age than in youth, but for the same reason that it has when
      people are weakened by sickness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Wanhope, &ldquo;that comparative indifference to death in the old, to
      whom it is so much nearer than it is to the young, is very suggestive.
      There may be something in what you say; they may not care so much because
      they have no longer the strength--the muscular strength--for caring. They
      are too tired to care as they used. There is a whole region of most
      important inquiry in that direction--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you mean to have him take that direction?&rdquo; Rulledge asked, sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can take any direction for me,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He is always delightful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, thank you!&rdquo; said Wanhope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I confess,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;that I was wondering whether the fact that
      the dying are indifferent to death could be established in the case of
      those who die in the flush of health and strength, like, for instance,
      people who are put to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wanhope smiled. &ldquo;I think it can--measurably. Most murderers make a good
      end, as the saying used to be, when they end on the scaffold, though they
      are not supported by religious fervor of any kind, or the exaltation of a
      high ideal. They go meekly and even cheerfully to their death, without
      rebellion or even objection. It is most exceptional that they make a fight
      for their lives, as that woman did a few years ago at Dannemora, and
      disgusted all refined people with capital punishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish they would make a fight always,&rdquo; said Rulledge, with unexpected
      feeling. &ldquo;It would do more than anything to put an end to that barbarity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be very interesting, as Wanhope says,&rdquo; Minver remarked. &ldquo;But
      aren&rsquo;t we getting rather far away? From the Ormonds, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are, rather,&rdquo; said Wanhope. &ldquo;Though I agree that it would be
      interesting. I should rather like to have it tried. You know Frederick
      Douglass acted upon some such principle when his master attempted to whip
      him. He fought, and he had a theory that if the slave had always fought
      there would soon have been an end of whipping, and so an end of slavery.
      But probably it will be a good while before criminals are--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Educated up to the idea,&rdquo; Minver proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Wanhope absently acquiesced. &ldquo;There seems to be a resignation
      intimated to the parting soul, whether in sickness or in health, by the
      mere proximity of death. In Ormond&rsquo;s case there seems to have been
      something more positive. His wife says that in the beginning of those days
      he used to come to her and wonder what could be the matter with him. He
      had a joy he could not account for by anything in their lives, and it made
      her tremble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably it didn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t think there was anything that could make Mrs.
      Ormond tremble, unless it was the chance that Ormond would get the last
      word,&rdquo; said Minver.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one minded him, and Wanhope continued: &ldquo;Of course she thought he must
      be going to have a fit of sickness, as the people say in the country, or
      used to say. Those expressions often survive in the common parlance long
      after the peculiar mental and moral conditions in which they originated
      have passed away. They must once have been more accurate than they are
      now. When one said &lsquo;fit of sickness&rsquo; one must have meant something
      specific; it would be interesting to know what. Women use those
      expressions longer than men; they seem to be inveterate in their nerves;
      and women apparently do their thinking in their nerves rather than their
      brains.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Wanhope had that distant look in his eyes which warned his familiars of a
      possible excursion, and I said, in the hope of keeping him from it, &ldquo;Then
      isn&rsquo;t there a turn of phrase somewhat analogous to that in a
      personification?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes--a personification,&rdquo; he repeated with a freshness of interest,
      which he presently accounted for. &ldquo;The place they had taken was very
      completely furnished. They got it fully equipped, even to linen and
      silver; but what was more important to poor Ormond was the library, very
      rich in the English classics, which appeared to go with the house. The
      owner was a girl who married and lived abroad, and these were her father&rsquo;s
      books. Mrs. Ormond said that her husband had the greatest pleasure in
      them: their print, which was good and black, and their paper, which was
      thin and yellowish, and their binding, which was tree calf in the poets,
      he specially liked. They were English editions as well as English
      classics, and she said he caressed the books, as he read them, with that
      touch which the book-lover has; he put his face into them, and inhaled
      their odor as if it were the bouquet of wine; he wanted her to like it,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she hated it,&rdquo; Minver said, unrelentingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not, if there was nobody else there,&rdquo; I urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      For once Wanhope was not to be tempted off on another scent. &ldquo;There was a
      good deal of old-fashioned fiction of the suspiratory and exclamatory
      sort, like Mackenzie&rsquo;s, and Sterne&rsquo;s and his followers, full of feeling,
      as people understood feeling a hundred years ago. But what Ormond rejoiced
      in most were the poets, good and bad, like Gray and Collins and Young, and
      their contemporaries, who personified nearly everything from Contemplation
      to Indigestion, through the whole range of the Vices, Virtues, Passions,
      Propensities, Attributes, and Qualities, and gave them each a dignified
      capital letter to wear. She said he used to come roaring to her with the
      passages in which these personifications flourished, and read them off
      with mock admiration, and then shriek and sputter with laughter. You know
      the way he had when a thing pleased him, especially a thing that had some
      relish of the quaint or rococo. As nearly as she would admit, in view of
      his loss, he bored her with these things. He was always hunting down some
      new personification, and when he had got it, adding it to the list he
      kept. She said he had thousands of them, but I suppose he had not so many.
      He had enough, though, to keep him amused, and she said he talked of
      writing something for the magazines about them, but probably he never
      would have done it. He never wrote anything, did he?&rdquo; Wanhope asked of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. He was far too literary for _that_,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;He had a
      reputation to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty good,&rdquo; said Minver, &ldquo;even if Ormond _is_ dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wanhope ignored us both. &ldquo;After awhile, his wife said, she began to notice
      a certain change in his attitude toward the personifications. She noticed
      this, always expecting that fit of sickness for him; but she was not so
      much troubled by his returning seriousness. Oh, I ought to tell you that
      when she first began to be anxious for him she privately wrote home to
      their family doctor, telling him how strangely happy Ormond was, and
      asking him if he could advise anything. He wrote back that if Ormond was
      so very happy they had better not do anything to cure him; that the
      disease was not infectious, and was seldom fatal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an ass!&rdquo; said Rulledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think he was, in this instance. But probably he had been consulted
      a good deal by Mrs. Ormond,&rdquo; said Wanhope. &ldquo;The change that began to set
      her mind at rest about Ormond was his taking the personifications more
      seriously. Why, he began to ask, but always with a certain measure of joke
      in it, why shouldn&rsquo;t there be something _in_ the personifications? Why
      shouldn&rsquo;t Morn and Eve come corporeally walking up their lawn, with little
      or no clothes on, or Despair be sitting in their woods with her hair over
      her face, or Famine coming gauntly up to their back door for a hand-out?
      Why shouldn&rsquo;t they any day see pop-eyed Rapture passing on the trolley, or
      Meditation letting the car she intended to take go by without stepping
      lively enough to get on board? He pretended that we could have the
      personifications back again, if we were not so conventional in our
      conceptions of them. He wanted to know what reason there was for
      representing Life as a very radiant and bounding party, when Life usually
      neither shone nor bounded; and why Death should be figured as an enemy
      with a dart, when it was so often the only friend a man had left, and had
      the habit of binding up wounds rather than inflicting them. The
      personifications were all right, he said, but the poets and painters did
      not know how they really looked. By the way,&rdquo; Wanhope broke off, &ldquo;did you
      happen to see Hauptmann&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hånnele&rsquo; when it was here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      None of us had, and we waited rather restively for the passing of the
      musing fit which he fell into. After a while he resumed at a point whose
      relation to the matter in hand we could trace:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was extremely interesting for all reasons, by its absolute
      fearlessness and freshness in regions where there has been nothing but
      timid convention for a long time; but what I was thinking of was the
      personification of Death as it appears there. The poor little dying
      pauper, lying in her dream at the almshouse, sees the figure of Death. It
      is not the skeleton with the dart, or the phantom with the shrouded face,
      but a tall, beautiful young man,--as beautiful as they could get into the
      cast, at any rate,--clothed in simple black, and standing with his back
      against the mantlepiece, with his hands resting on the hilt of a long,
      two-handed sword. He is so quiet that you do not see him until some time
      after the child has seen him. When she begins to question him whether she
      may not somehow get to heaven without dying, he answers with a sort of
      sorrowful tenderness, a very sweet and noble compassion, but unsparingly
      as to his mission. It is a singular moment of pure poetry that makes the
      heart ache, but does not crush or terrify the spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what has it got to do with Ormond?&rdquo; asked Rulledge, but with less
      impatience than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, nothing, I&rsquo;m afraid, that I can make out very clearly. And yet there
      is an obscure connection with Ormond, or his vision, if it was a vision.
      Mrs. Ormond could not be very definite about what he saw, perhaps because
      even at the last moment he was not definite himself. What she was clear
      about, was the fact that his mood, though it became more serious, by no
      means became sadder. It became a sort of solemn joy instead of the light
      gaiety it had begun by being. She was no sort of scientific observer, and
      yet the keenness of her affection made her as closely observant of Ormond
      as if she had been studying him psychologically. Sometimes the light in
      his room would wake her at night, and she would go to him, and find him
      lying with a book faced down on his breast, as if he had been reading, and
      his fingers interlaced under his head, and a kind of radiant peace in his
      face. The poor thing said that when she would ask him what the matter was,
      he would say, &lsquo;Nothing; just happiness,&rsquo; and when she would ask him if he
      did not think he ought to do something, he would laugh, and say perhaps it
      would go off of itself. But it did not go off; the unnatural buoyancy
      continued after he became perfectly tranquil. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; he would
      say. &lsquo;I seem to have got to the end of my troubles. I haven&rsquo;t a care in
      the world, Jenny. I don&rsquo;t believe you could get a rise out of me if you
      said the nastiest thing you could think of. It sounds like nonsense, of
      course, but it seems to me that I have found out the reason of things,
      though I don&rsquo;t know what it is. Maybe I&rsquo;ve only found out that there _is_
      a reason of things. That would be enough, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;&rdquo; <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      V.
    </h3>
    <p>
      At this point Wanhope hesitated with a kind of diffidence that was rather
      charming in him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just how I can keep the facts
      from this on out of the line of facts which we are not in the habit of
      respecting very much, or that we relegate to the company of things that
      are not facts at all. I suppose that in stating them I shall somehow make
      myself responsible for them, but that is just what I don&rsquo;t want to do. I
      don&rsquo;t want to do anything more than give them as they were given to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be able to give them half as fully,&rdquo; said Minver, &ldquo;if Mrs.
      Ormond gave them to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Wanhope said gravely, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s the pity of it; for they ought to
      be given as fully as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Rulledge commanded, &ldquo;and do the best you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo;
       the psychologist thoughtfully said, &ldquo;that I am quite satisfied to call
      Ormond&rsquo;s experiences hallucinations. There ought to be some other word
      that doesn&rsquo;t accuse his sanity in that degree. For he apparently didn&rsquo;t
      show any other signs of an unsound mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None that Mrs. Ormond would call so,&rdquo; Minver suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in his case, I don&rsquo;t think she was such a bad judge,&rdquo; Wanhope
      returned. &ldquo;She was a tolerably unbalanced person herself, but she wasn&rsquo;t
      altogether disqualified for observing him, as I&rsquo;ve said before. They had a
      pretty hot summer, as the summer is apt to be in the Housatonic valley,
      but when it got along into September the weather was divine, and they
      spent nearly the whole time out of doors, driving over the hills. They got
      an old horse from a native, and they hunted out a rickety buggy from the
      carriage-house, and they went wherever the road led. They went mostly at a
      walk, and that suited the horse exactly, as well as Mrs. Ormond, who had
      no faith in Ormond&rsquo;s driving, and wanted to go at a pace that would give
      her a chance to jump out safely if anything happened. They put their hats
      in the front of the buggy, and went about in their bare heads. The country
      people got used to them, and were not scandalized by their appearance,
      though they were both getting a little gray, and must have looked as if
      they were old enough to know better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were not really old, as age goes nowadays: he was not more than
      forty-two or -three, and she was still in the late thirties. In fact, they
      were
    </p>
    <p>
      Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita--
    </p>
    <p>
      in that hour when life, and the conceit of life, is strongest, and when it
      feels as if it might go on forever. Women are not very articulate about
      such things, and it was probably Ormond who put their feeling into words,
      though she recognized at once that it was her feeling, and shrank from it
      as if it were something wicked, that they would be punished for; so that
      one day, when he said suddenly, &lsquo;Jenny, I don&rsquo;t feel as if I could ever
      die,&rsquo; she scolded him for it. Poor women!&rdquo; said Wanhope, musingly, &ldquo;they
      are not always cross when they scold. It is often the expression of their
      anxieties, their forebodings, their sex-timidities. They are always in
      double the danger that men are, and their nerves double that danger again.
      Who was that famous _salonnière_--Mme. Geoffrin, was it?--that Marmontel
      says always scolded her friends when they were in trouble, and came and
      scolded him when he was put into the Bastille? I suppose Mrs. Ormond was
      never so tender of Ormond as she was when she took it out of him for
      suggesting what she wildly felt herself, and felt she should pay for
      feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wanhope had the effect of appealing to Minver, but the painter would not
      relent. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve seen her--or heard her--in very devoted
      moments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; Wanhope resumed, &ldquo;she says she scolded him, and it did not
      do the least good. She could not scold him out of that feeling, which was
      all mixed up in her retrospect with the sense of the weather and the
      season, the leaves just beginning to show the autumn, the wild asters
      coming to crowd the goldenrod, the crickets shrill in the grass, and the
      birds silent in the trees, the smell of the rowan in the meadows, and the
      odor of the old logs and fresh chips in the woods. She was not a woman to
      notice such things much, but he talked of them all and made her notice
      them. His nature took hold upon what we call nature, and clung fondly to
      the lowly and familiar aspects of it. Once she said to him, trembling for
      him, &lsquo;I should think you would be afraid to take such a pleasure in those
      things,&rsquo; and when he asked her why, she couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t tell him; but
      he understood, and he said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve never realized before that I was so much
      a part of them. Either I am going to have them forever, or they are going
      to have me. We shall not part, for we are all members of the same body. If
      it is the body of death, we are members of that. If it is the body of
      life, we are members of that. Either I have never lived, or else I am
      never going to die.&rsquo; She said: &lsquo;Of course you are never going to die; a
      spirit can&rsquo;t die.&rsquo; But he told her he didn&rsquo;t mean that. He was just as
      radiantly happy when they would get home from one of their drives, and sit
      down to their supper, which they had country-fashion instead of dinner,
      and then when they would turn into their big, lamplit parlor, and sit down
      for a long evening with his books. Sometimes he read to her as she sewed,
      but he read mostly to himself, and he said he hadn&rsquo;t had such a bath of
      poetry since he was a boy. Sometimes in the splendid nights, which were so
      clear that you could catch the silver glint of the gossamers in the thin
      air, he would go out and walk up and down the long veranda. Once, when he
      coaxed her out with him, he took her under the arm and walked her up and
      down, and he said: &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it like a ship? The earth is like a ship, and
      we&rsquo;re sailing, sailing! Oh, I wonder where!&rsquo; Then he stopped with a sob,
      and she was startled, and asked him what the matter was, but he couldn&rsquo;t
      tell her. She was more frightened than ever at what seemed a break in his
      happiness. She was troubled about his reading the Bible so much,
      especially the Old Testament; but he told her he had never known before
      what majestic literature it was. There were some turns or phrases in it
      that peculiarly took his fancy and seemed to feed it with inexhaustible
      suggestion. &lsquo;The Angel of the Lord&rsquo; was one of these. The idea of a divine
      messenger, embodied and commissioned to intimate the creative will to the
      creature: it was sublime, it was ineffable. He wondered that men had ever
      come to think in any other terms of the living law that we were under, and
      that could much less conceivably operate like an insensate mechanism than
      it could reveal itself as a constant purpose. He said he believed that in
      every great moral crisis, in every ordeal of conscience, a man was aware
      of standing in the presence of something sent to try him and test him, and
      that this something was the Angel of the Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went off that night, saying to himself, &lsquo;The Angel of the Lord, the
      Angel of the Lord!&rsquo; and when she lay a long time awake, waiting for him to
      go to sleep, she heard him saying it again in his room. She thought he
      might be dreaming, but when she went to him, he had his lamp lighted, and
      was lying with that rapt smile on his face which she was so afraid of. She
      told him she was afraid and she wished he would not say such things; and
      that made him laugh, and he put his arms round her, and laughed and
      laughed, and said it was only a kind of swearing, and she must cheer up.
      He let her give him some trional to make him sleep, and then she went off
      to her bed again. But when they both woke late, she heard him, as he
      dressed, repeating fragments of verse, quoting quite without order, as the
      poem drifted through his memory. He told her at breakfast that it was a
      poem which Longfellow had written to Lowell upon the occasion of his
      wife&rsquo;s death, and he wanted to get it and read it to her. She said she did
      not see how he could let his mind run on such gloomy things. But he
      protested he was not the least gloomy, and that he supposed his
      recollection of the poem was a continuation of his thinking about the
      Angel of the Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While they were at table a tramp came up the drive under the window, and
      looked in at them hungrily. He was a very offensive tramp, and quite took
      Mrs. Ormond&rsquo;s appetite away: but Ormond would not send him round to the
      kitchen, as she wanted; he insisted upon taking him a plate and a cup of
      coffee out on the veranda himself. When she expostulated with him, he
      answered fantastically that the fellow might be an angel of the Lord, and
      he asked her if she remembered Parnell&rsquo;s poem of &lsquo;The Hermit.&rsquo; Of course
      she didn&rsquo;t, but he needn&rsquo;t get it, for she didn&rsquo;t want to hear it, and if
      he kept making her so nervous, she should be sick herself. He insisted
      upon telling her what the poem was, and how the angel in it had made
      himself abhorrent to the hermit by throttling the babe of the good man who
      had housed and fed them, and committing other atrocities, till the hermit
      couldn&rsquo;t stand it any longer, and the angel explained that he had done it
      all to prevent the greater harm that would have come if he had not killed
      and stolen in season. Ormond laughed at her disgust, and said he was
      curious to see what a tramp would do that was treated with real
      hospitality. He thought they had made a mistake in not asking this tramp
      in to breakfast with them; then they might have stood a chance of being
      murdered in their beds to save them from mischief.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      VI.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Ormond really lost her patience with him, and felt better than she
      had for a long time by scolding him in good earnest. She told him he was
      talking very blasphemously, and when he urged that his morality was
      directly in line with Parnell&rsquo;s, and Parnell was an archbishop, she was so
      vexed that she would not go to drive with him that morning, though he
      apologized and humbled himself in every way. He pleaded that it was such a
      beautiful day, it must be the last they were going to have; it was getting
      near the equinox, and this must be a weather-breeder. She let him go off
      alone, for he would not lose the drive, and she watched him out of sight
      from her upper window with a heavy heart. As soon as he was fairly gone,
      she wanted to go after him, and she was wild all the forenoon. She could
      not stay indoors, but kept walking up and down the piazza and looking for
      him, and at times she went a bit up the road he had taken, to meet him.
      She had got to thinking of the tramp, though the man had gone directly off
      down another road after he had his breakfast. At last she heard the old
      creaking, rattling buggy, and as soon as she saw Ormond&rsquo;s bare head, and
      knew he was all right, she ran up to her room and shut herself in. But she
      couldn&rsquo;t hold out against him when he came to her door with an armful of
      wild flowers that he had gathered for her, and boughs from some young
      maples that he had found all red in a swamp. She showed herself so
      interested that he asked her to come with him after their midday dinner
      and see them, and she said perhaps she would, if he would promise not to
      keep talking about the things that made her so miserable. He asked her,
      &lsquo;What things?&rsquo; and she answered that he knew well enough, and he laughed
      and promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t believe he would keep his word, but he did at first, and he
      tried not to tease her in any way. He tried to please her in the whims and
      fancies she had about going this way or that, and when she decided not to
      look up his young maples with him, because the first autumn leaves made
      her melancholy, he submitted. He put his arm across her shoulder as they
      drove through the woods, and pulled her to him, and called her &lsquo;poor old
      thing,&rsquo; and accused her of being morbid. He wanted her to tell him all
      there was in her mind, but she could not; she could only cry on his arm.
      He asked her if it was something about him that troubled her, and she
      could only say that she hated to see people so cheerful without reason.
      That made him laugh, and they were very gay after she had got her cry out;
      but he grew serious again. Then her temper rose, and she asked, &lsquo;Well,
      what is it?&rsquo; and he said at first, &lsquo;Oh, nothing,&rsquo; as people do when there
      is really something, and presently he confessed that he was thinking about
      what she had said of his being cheerful without reason. Then, as she said,
      he talked so beautifully that she had to keep her patience with him,
      though he was not keeping his word to her. His talk, as far as she was
      able to report it, didn&rsquo;t amount to much more than this: that in a world
      where death was, people never could be cheerful with reason unless death
      was something altogether different from what people imagined. After people
      came to their intellectual consciousness, death was never wholly out of
      it, and if they could be joyful with that black drop at the bottom of
      every cup, it was proof positive that death was not what it seemed.
      Otherwise there was no logic in the scheme of being, but it was a cruel
      fraud by the Creator upon the creature; a poor practical joke, with the
      laugh all on one side. He had got rid of his fear of it in that light,
      which seemed to have come to him before the fear left him, and he wanted
      her to see it in the same light, and if he died before her--But there she
      stopped him and protested that it would kill her if she did not die first,
      with no apparent sense, even when she told me, of her fatuity, which must
      have amused poor Ormond. He said what he wanted to ask was that she would
      believe he had not been the least afraid to die, and he wished her to
      remember this always, because she knew how he always used to be afraid of
      dying. Then he really began to talk of other things, and he led the way
      back to the times of their courtship and their early married days, and
      their first journeys together, and all their young-people friends, and the
      simple-hearted pleasure they used to take in society, in teas and dinners,
      and going to the theater. He did not like to think how that pleasure had
      dropped out of their life, and he did not know why they had let it, and he
      was going to have it again when they went to town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They had thought of staying a long time in the country, perhaps till
      after Thanksgiving, for they had become attached to their place; but now
      they suddenly agreed to go back to New York at once. She told me that as
      soon as they agreed she felt a tremendous longing to be gone that instant,
      as if she must go to escape from something, some calamity, and she felt,
      looking back, that there was a prophetic quality in her eagerness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she was always so,&rdquo; said Minver. &ldquo;When a thing was to be done, she
      wanted it done like lightning, no matter what the thing was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, very likely,&rdquo; Wanhope consented. &ldquo;I never make much account of
      those retroactive forebodings. At any rate, she says she wanted him to
      turn about and drive home so that they could begin packing, and when he
      demurred, and began to tease, as she called it, she felt as if she should
      scream, till he turned the old horse and took the back track. She was
      _wild_ to get home, and kept hurrying him, and wanting him to whip the
      horse; but the old horse merely wagged his tail, and declined to go faster
      than a walk, and this was the only thing that enabled her to forgive
      herself afterward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what had she done?&rdquo; Rulledge asked. &ldquo;She would have been responsible
      for what happened, according to her notion, if she had had her way with
      the horse; she would have felt that she had driven Ormond to his doom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; said Minver. &ldquo;She always found a hole to creep out of. Why
      couldn&rsquo;t she go back a little further, and hold herself responsible
      through having made him turn round?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor woman!&rdquo; said Rulledge, with a tenderness that made Minver smile.
      &ldquo;What was it that did happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wanhope examined his cup for some dregs of coffee, and then put it down
      with an air of resignation. I offered to touch the bell, but, &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m better without it.&rdquo; And he went on: &ldquo;There was a lonely
      piece of woods that they had to drive through before they struck the
      avenue leading to their house, which was on a cheerful upland overlooking
      the river, and when they had got about half-way through this woods, the
      tramp whom Ormond had fed in the morning, slipped out of a thicket on the
      hillside above them, and crossed the road in front of them, and slipped
      out of sight among the trees on the slope below. Ormond stopped the horse,
      and turned to his wife with a strange kind of whisper. &lsquo;Did you see it?&rsquo; 
      he asked, and she answered yes, and bade him drive on. He did so, slowly
      looking back round the side of the buggy till a turn of the road hid the
      place where the tramp had crossed their track. She could not speak, she
      says, till they came in sight of their house. Then her heart gave a great
      bound, and she broke out on him, blaming him for having encouraged the
      tramp to lurk about, as he must have done, all day, by his foolish
      sentimentality in taking his breakfast out to him. &lsquo;He saw that you were a
      delicate person, and now to-night he will be coming round, and--&rsquo; She says
      Ormond kept looking at her, while she talked, as if he did not know what
      she was saying, and all at once she glanced down at their feet, and
      discovered that her hat was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, she owned, made her frantic, and she blazed out at him again, and
      accused him of having lost her hat by stopping to look at that worthless
      fellow, and then starting up the horse so suddenly that it had rolled out.
      He usually gave her as good as she sent when she let herself go in that
      way, and she told me she would have been glad if he had done it now, but
      he only looked at her in a kind of daze, and when he understood, at last,
      he bade her get out and go into the house--they were almost at the
      door,--and he would go back and find her hat himself. &lsquo;Indeed, you&rsquo;ll do
      nothing of the kind,&rsquo; she said she told him. &lsquo;I shall go back with you, or
      you&rsquo;ll be hunting up that precious vagabond and bringing him home to
      supper.&rsquo; Ormond said, &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; with a kind of dreamy passivity, and he
      turned the old horse again, and they drove slowly back, looking for the
      hat in the road, right and left. She had not noticed before that it was
      getting late, and perhaps it was not so late as it seemed when they got
      into that lonely piece of woods again, and the veils of shadow began to
      drop round them, as if they were something falling from the trees, she
      said. They found the hat easily enough at the point where it must have
      rolled out of the buggy, and he got down and picked it up. She kept
      scolding him, but he did not seem to hear her. He stood dangling the hat
      by its ribbons from his right hand, while he rested his left on the
      dashboard, and looking--looking down into the wooded slope where the tramp
      had disappeared. A cold chill went over her, and she stopped her scolding.
      &lsquo;Oh, Jim,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;do you see something? What do you see?&rsquo; He flung the
      hat from him, and ran plunging down the hillside--she covered up her face
      when she told me, and said she should always see him running--till the
      dusk among the trees hid him. She ran after him, and she heard him
      calling, calling joyfully, &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m coming!&rsquo; and she thought he was
      calling back to her, but the rush of his feet kept getting farther, and
      then he seemed to stop with a sound like falling. He couldn&rsquo;t have been
      much ahead of her, for it was only a moment till she stood on the edge of
      a boulder in the woods, looking over, and there at the bottom Ormond was
      lying with his face turned under him, as she expressed it; and the tramp,
      with a heavy stick in his hand, was standing by him, stooping over him,
      and staring at him. She began to scream, and it seemed to her that she
      flew down from the brink of the rock, and caught the tramp and clung to
      him, while she kept screaming &lsquo;Murder!&rsquo; The man didn&rsquo;t try to get away; he
      only said, over and over, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t touch him, lady; I didn&rsquo;t touch him.&rsquo; 
      It all happened simultaneously, like events in a dream, and while there
      was nobody there but herself and the tramp, and Ormond lying between them,
      there were some people that must have heard her from the road and come
      down to her. They were neighbor-folk that knew her and Ormond, and they
      naturally laid hold of the tramp; but he didn&rsquo;t try to escape. He helped
      them gather poor Ormond up, and he went back to the house with them, and
      staid while one of them ran for the doctor. The doctor could only tell
      them that Ormond was dead, and that his neck must have been broken by his
      fall over the rock. One of the neighbors went to look at the place the
      next morning, and found one of the roots of a young tree growing on the
      rock, torn out, as if Ormond had caught his foot in it; and that had
      probably made his fall a headlong dive. The tramp knew nothing but that he
      heard shouting and running, and got up from the foot of the rock, where he
      was going to pass the night, when something came flying through the air,
      and struck at his feet. Then it scarcely stirred, and the next thing, he
      said, the lady was _onto_ him, screeching and tearing. He piteously
      protested his innocence, which was apparent enough, at the inquest, and
      before, for that matter. He said Ormond was about the only man that ever
      treated him white, and Mrs. Ormond was remorseful for having let him get
      away before she could tell him that she didn&rsquo;t blame him, and ask him to
      forgive her.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> <br />

      VII.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Wanhope desisted with a provisional air, and Rulledge went and got Himself
      a sandwich from the lunch-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, upon my word!&rdquo; said Minver. &ldquo;I thought you had dined, Rulledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rulledge came back munching, and said to Wanhope, as he settled himself in
      his chair again: &ldquo;Well, go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The psychologist was silent, with Rulledge staring indignantly at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Mrs. Ormond had her theory?&rdquo; I ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes--such as it was,&rdquo; said Wanhope. &ldquo;It was her belief--her
      religion--that Ormond had seen Death, in person or personified, or the
      angel of it; and that the sight was something beautiful, and not terrible.
      She thought that she should see Death, too in the same way, as a
      messenger. I don&rsquo;t know that it was such a bad theory,&rdquo; he added
      impartially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not,&rdquo; said Minver, &ldquo;if you suppose that Ormond was off his nut. But, in
      regard to the whole matter, there is always a question of how much truth
      there was in what she said about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; the psychologist admitted, &ldquo;that is a question which must be
      considered. The question of testimony in such matters is the difficult
      thing. You might often believe in supernatural occurrences if it were not
      for the witnesses. It is very interesting,&rdquo; he pursued, with his
      scientific smile, &ldquo;to note how corrupting anything supernatural or
      mystical is. Such things seem mostly to happen either in the privity of
      people who are born liars, or else they deprave the spectator so, through
      his spiritual vanity or his love of the marvelous, that you can&rsquo;t believe
      a word he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are as bad as horses on human morals,&rdquo; said Minver. &ldquo;Not that I
      think it ever needed the coming of a ghost to invalidate any statement of
      Mrs. Ormond&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Rulledge rose and went away growling something, partially
      audible, to the disadvantage of Minver&rsquo;s wit, and the painter laughed
      after him: &ldquo;He really believes it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wanhope&rsquo;s mind seemed to be shifted from Mrs. Ormond to her convert, whom
      he followed with his tolerant eyes. &ldquo;Nothing in all this sort of inquiry
      is so impossible to predicate as the effect of any given instance upon a
      given mind. It would be very interesting--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me!&rdquo; said Minver. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Whitley. I must speak to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went away, leaving me alone with the psychologist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is your own conclusion in this instance?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I haven&rsquo;t formulated it yet.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> <br />

    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p>
      You are very welcome to the Alderling incident, my dear Acton, if you
      think you can do anything with it, and I will give it as circumstantially
      as possible. The thing has its limitations, I should think, for the
      fictionist, chiefly in a sort of roundedness which leaves little play to
      the imagination. It seems to me that it would be more to your purpose if
      it were less _pat_, in its catastrophe, but you are a better judge of all
      that than I am, and I will put the facts in your hands, and keep my own
      hands off, so far as any plastic use of the material is concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first I knew of the peculiar Alderling situation was shortly after
      William James&rsquo;s &ldquo;Will to Believe&rdquo; came out. I had been telling the
      Alderlings about it, for they had not seen it, and I noticed that from
      time to time they looked significantly at each other. When I had got
      through he gave a little laugh, and she said, &ldquo;Oh, you may laugh!&rdquo; and
      then I made bold to ask, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marion can tell you,&rdquo; he said. He motioned towards the coffee-pot and
      asked, &ldquo;More?&rdquo; I shook my head, and he said, &ldquo;Come out and let us see what
      the maritime interests have been doing for us. Pipe or cigar?&rdquo; I chose
      cigarettes, and he brought the box off the table, stopping on his way to
      the veranda, and taking his pipe and tobacco-pouch from the hall mantel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Alderling had got to the veranda before us, and done things to the
      chairs and cushions, and was leaning against one of the slender fluted
      pine columns like some rich, blond caryatid just off duty, with the blue
      of her dress and the red of her hair showing deliciously against the
      background of white house-wall. He and she were an astonishing and
      satisfying contrast; in the midst of your amazement you felt the divine
      propriety of a woman like her wanting just such a wiry,
      smoky-complexioned, black-browed, black-bearded, bald-headed little man as
      he was. Before he sat down where she was going to put him, he stood
      stoopingly, and frowned at the waters of the cove lifting from the foot of
      the lawn that sloped to it before the house. &ldquo;Three lumbermen, two
      goodish-sized yachts, a dozen sloop-rigged boats: not so bad. About the
      usual number that come loafing in to spend the night. You ought to see
      them when it threatens to breeze up. Then they&rsquo;re here in flocks. Go on,
      Marion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a soft groan of comfort as he settled in his chair and began
      pulling at his short black pipe, and she let her eyes dwell on him in a
      rapture that curiously interested me. People in love are rarely
      interesting--that is, flesh-and-blood people. Of course I know that lovers
      are the life of fiction, and that a story of any kind can scarcely hold
      the reader without them. The love-interest, as they call it, is also
      supposed to be essential to the drama, and friends of mine who have tried
      to foist their plays upon managers have been overthrown by the objection
      that the love-interest is not strong enough in what they have done. Yet
      lovers in real life are, so far as I have observed them, bores. They are
      confessed to be disgusting before or after marriage when they let their
      fondness appear, but even when they try to hide it, they are tiresome.
      Character goes down before passion in them; nature is reduced to
      propensity. Then, how is it that the novelist manages to keep these, and
      to give us nature and character while seeming to offer nothing but
      propensity and passion? Perhaps he does not give them. Perhaps what he
      does is to hypnotize us so that we each of us identify ourselves with the
      lovers, and add our own natures and characters to the single principle
      that animates them. The reason we like, that we endure, to read about
      them, may be that they are ourselves rendered objective in an instant of
      intense vitality, without the least trouble or risk to us. But if we have
      them there before us in the tiresome reality, they exclude us from their
      pleasure in each other and stop up the perspective of our happiness with
      their hulking personalities, bare of all the iridescence of potentiality,
      which we could have cast about them. Something of this iridescence may
      cling to unmarried lovers, in spite of themselves, but wedded bliss is a
      sheer offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know why it was not an offence in the case of the Alderlings,
      unless it was because they both, in their different ways, saw the joke of
      the thing. At any rate, I found that in their charm for each other they
      had somehow not ceased to be amusing for me, and I waited confidently for
      the answer she would make to his whimsically abrupt bidding. But she did
      not answer very promptly, even when he had added, &ldquo;Wanhope, here, is
      scenting something psychological in the reason of my laughing at you,
      instead of accepting the plain inference in the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the plain inference?&rdquo; I asked, partly to fill up Mrs. Alderling&rsquo;s
      continued silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a man laughs at a woman for no apparent reason it is because he is
      amused at her being afraid of him when he is so much more afraid of her,
      or puzzled by him when she is such an incomparable riddle herself, or
      caring for him when he knows he is not worth his salt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t expect to put me off with that sort of thing,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, go on Marion,&rdquo; Alderling repeated. <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mrs. Alderling stood looking at him, not me, with a smile hovering about
      the corners of her mouth, which, when it decided not to alight anywhere,
      scarcely left her aspect graver for its flitting. She said at last, in her
      slow, deep-throated voice, &ldquo;I guess I will let you tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll tell him fast enough,&rdquo; said Alderling, nursing his knee, and
      bringing it well up toward his chin, between his clasped hands. &ldquo;Marion
      has always had the notion that I should live again if I believed I should,
      and that as I don&rsquo;t believe I shall, I am not going to. The joke of it
      is,&rdquo; and he began to splutter laughter round the stem of his pipe, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s
      as much of an agnostic as I am. She doesn&rsquo;t believe she is going to live
      again, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Alderling said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for it in my case.&rdquo; That struck me as
      rather touching, but I had no right to enter uninvited into the intimacy
      of her meaning, and I said, looking as little at her as I need, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t
      you both rather belated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that protoplasm has gone out?&rdquo; he chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;But you know that a great many things are
      allowed now that were once forbidden to the True Disbeliever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that we may trust in the promises, as they used to be called,
      and still keep the Unfaith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alderling took his pipe out, apparently to give his whole face to the
      pleasure of teasing his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be a great comfort to Marion,&rdquo; he said, and he threw back his
      head and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled faintly, vaguely, tolerantly, as if she enjoyed his pleasure in
      teasing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;that you don&rsquo;t know the changed attitude
      in these matters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here for the last three years. We tried it the first winter after
      we came, and found it was not so bad, and we simply stayed on. But I
      haven&rsquo;t really looked into the question since I gave the conundrum up
      twenty years ago, on what was then the best authority. Marion doesn&rsquo;t
      complain. She knew what I was when she married me. She was another. We
      were neither of us very bigoted disbelievers. We should not have burned
      anybody at the stake for saying that we had souls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alderling put back his pipe and cackled round it, taking his knee between
      his hands again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she explained, more in my direction than to me, &ldquo;that I had
      none to begin with. But Alderling had. His people believed in the future
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they said,&rdquo; Alderling crowed. &ldquo;And Marion has always thought
      that if she had believed that way, she could have kept me up to it; and so
      when I died I should have lived again. It is perfectly logical, though it
      isn&rsquo;t capable of a practical demonstration. If Marion had come of a
      believing family, she could have brought me back into the fold. Her great
      mistake was in being brought up by an uncle who denied that he was living
      here, even. The poor girl could not do a thing when it came to the life
      hereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile now came hovering back, and alighted at a corner of Mrs.
      Alderling&rsquo;s mouth, making it look, oddly enough, rather rueful. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t
      matter about me. I thought it a pity that Alderling&rsquo;s talent should stop
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever know anything like that?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Perfectly willing to
      thrust me out into a cold other-world, and leave me to struggle on without
      her, when I had got used to her looking after me. Now I&rsquo;m not so selfish
      as that. I shouldn&rsquo;t want to have Marion living on through all eternity if
      I wasn&rsquo;t with her. It would be too lonely for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at her, with his dancing eyes, and she put her hand down over
      his shoulder into the hand that he lifted to meet it, in a way that would
      have made me sick in some people. But in her the action was so casual, so
      absent, that it did not affect me disagreeably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that you haven&rsquo;t been away since you came here three years
      ago?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ran up to the theatre once in Boston last winter, but it bored us to
      the limit.&rdquo; Alderling poked his knife-blade into the bowl of his pipe as
      he spoke, having freed his hand for the purpose, while Mrs. Alderling
      leaned back against the slim column again. He said gravely: &ldquo;It was a
      great thing for Marion, though. In view of the railroad accident that
      didn&rsquo;t happen, she convinced herself that her sole ambition was that we
      should die together. Then, whether we found ourselves alive or not, we
      should be company for each other. She&rsquo;s got it arranged with the
      thunderstorms, so that one bolt will do for us both, and she never lets me
      go out on the water alone, for fear I shall watch my chance, and get
      drowned without her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not trouble myself to make out how much of this was mocking, and as
      there was no active participation in the joke expected of me, I kept on
      the safe side of laughing. &ldquo;No wonder you&rsquo;ve been able to do such a lot of
      pictures,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But I should have thought you might have found it
      dull--I mean dull together--at odd times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dull?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s stupendously dull! Especially when our country
      neighbors come in to &lsquo;&rsquo;liven us up.&rsquo; We&rsquo;ve got neighbors here that can
      stay longer in half an hour than most people can in a week. We get tired
      of each other at times, but after a call from the people in the next
      house, we return with rapture to our delusion that we are interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you never,&rdquo; I ventured, making my jocosity as ironical as possible,
      &ldquo;wear upon each other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horribly!&rdquo; said Alderling, and his wife smiled contentedly, behind him.
      &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t a whole set of china in the house, from exchanging it across
      the table, and I haven&rsquo;t made a study of Marion--you must have noticed how
      many Marions there were that she hasn&rsquo;t thrown at my head. Especially the
      Madonnas. She likes to throw the Madonnas at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I ventured still farther, addressing myself to Mrs. Alderling. &ldquo;Does he
      keep it up all the time--this blague?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty much,&rdquo; she answered passively, with entire acquiescence in the
      fact if it were the fact, or the joke if it were the joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t see anything of yours, Mrs. Alderling,&rdquo; I said. She had had
      her talent, as a girl, and some people preferred it to her husband&rsquo;s,--but
      there was no effect of it anywhere in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The housekeeping is enough,&rdquo; she answered, with her tranquil smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing in her smile that was leading, and I did not push my
      inquiry, especially as Alderling did not seem disposed to assist. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
       I said, &ldquo;I suppose you will forgive to science my feeling that your
      situation is most suggestive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t mind _us!_&rdquo; said Alderling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, thank you,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s equal to being cast away
      together on an uninhabited island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; he assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;be a corner of your minds that you haven&rsquo;t
      mutually explored. You must know each other,&rdquo; I cast about for the word,
      and added abruptly, &ldquo;by heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose he meant anything pretty?&rdquo; said Alderling, with a look up
      over his shoulder at his wife; and then he said to me, &ldquo;We do; and there
      are some very curious things I could tell you, if Marion would ever let me
      get in a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do let him, Mrs. Alderling,&rdquo; I entreated, humoring his joke at her
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, and softly shrugged, and then sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could make your flesh creep,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;or I could if you were not a
      psychologist. I assure you that we are quite weird at times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just knowing what the other is thinking, at a given moment, and
      saying it. There are times when Marion&rsquo;s thinking is such a nuisance to
      me, that I have to yell down to her from my loft to stop it. The racket it
      makes breaks me all up. It&rsquo;s a relief to have her talk, and I try to make
      her, when she&rsquo;s posing, just to escape the din of her thinking. Then the
      willing! We experimented with it, after we had first noticed it, but we
      don&rsquo;t any more. It&rsquo;s too dead easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by the willing?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just wishing one that the other was there, and there he or she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he trying to work me, Mrs. Alderling?&rdquo; I appealed to her, and she
      answered from her calm:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very unaccountable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you really mean it! Why can&rsquo;t you give me an illustration?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you know,&rdquo; said Alderling more seriously than he had yet spoken, &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t believe those things, if they are real, can ever be got to show off.
      That&rsquo;s the reason why your &lsquo;Quests in the Occult&rsquo; are mainly such rubbish,
      as far as the evidences are concerned. If Marion and I tried to give you
      an illustration, as you call it, the occult would snub us. But, is there
      anything so very strange about it? The wonder _is_ that a man and wife
      ever fail of knowing each what the other is thinking. They pervade each
      other&rsquo;s minds, if they are really married, and they are so present with
      each other that the tacit wish should be the same as a call. Marion and I
      are only an intensified instance of what may be done by living together.
      There is something, though, that is rather queer, but it belongs to
      psychomancy rather than psychology, as I understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What is that queer something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being visibly present when absent. It has not happened often, but it has
      happened that I have seen Marion in my loft when she was really somewhere
      else and not when I had willed her or wished her to be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, really,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I must ask you for an instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to heap up facts, Lombroso fashion? Well, this is as good as
      most of Lombroso&rsquo;s facts, or better. I went up one morning, last winter,
      to work at a study of a Madonna from Marion, directly after breakfast, and
      left her below in the dining-room, putting away the breakfast things. She
      has to do that occasionally, between the local helps, who are all we can
      get in the winter. She professes to like it, but you never can tell, from
      what a woman says; she has to do it, anyway.&rdquo; It is hard to convey a
      notion of the serene, impersonal acquiescence of Mrs. Alderling in taking
      this talk of her. &ldquo;I was banging away at it when I knew she was behind me
      looking over my shoulder rather more stormily than she usually does;
      usually, she is a dead calm. I glanced up, and saw the calm succeed the
      storm. I kept on, and after awhile I was aware of hearing her step on the
      stairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alderling stopped, and smoked definitively, as if that were the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, after waiting a while, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly get the unique
      value of the incident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, as if he had accidentally forgotten the detail, &ldquo;the steps
      were coming up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She opened the door, which she had omitted to do before, and when she
      came in she denied having been there already. She owned that she had been
      hurrying through her work, and thinking of mine, so as to make me do
      something, or undo something, to it; and then all at once she lost her
      impatience, and came up at her leisure. I don&rsquo;t exactly like to tell what
      she wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to laugh provokingly, and she said, tranquilly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind
      your telling Mr. Wanhope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, strictly in the interest of psychomancy, I will confide that
      she had found some traces of a model that I used to paint my Madonnas
      from, before we were married, in that picture. She had slept on her
      suspicion, and then when she could not stand it any longer, she had come
      up in the spirit to say that she was not going to be mixed up in a Madonna
      with any such minx. The words are mine, but the meaning was Marion&rsquo;s. When
      she found me taking the minx out, she went quietly back to washing her
      dishes, and then returned in the body to give me a sitting.&rdquo; <br /> <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      We were silent a moment, till I asked, &ldquo;Is this true, Mrs. Alderling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember the storm, exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see why you bother to remain in the body at all,&rdquo; I
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t arranged just how to leave it together,&rdquo; said Alderling.
      &ldquo;Marion, here, if I managed to get off first, would have no means of
      knowing whether her theory of the effect of my unbelief on my future was
      right or not; and if _she_ gave _me_ the slip, she would always be sorry
      that she had not stayed here to convert me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you agree that if either of you lives again, he or she shall
      make some sign to let the other know?&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;Well, that has been
      tried so often, and has it ever worked? It&rsquo;s open to the question whether
      the dead do not fail to show up because they are forbidden to communicate
      with the living; and you are just where you were, as to the main point.
      No, I don&rsquo;t see any way out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Alderling went into the house and came out with a book in her hand,
      and her fingers in it at two places. It was that impressive collection of
      Christ&rsquo;s words from the New Testament called &ldquo;The Great Discourse.&rdquo; She
      put the book before me, first at one place and then at another, and I
      read, &ldquo;Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die,&rdquo; and then,
      &ldquo;Nay, but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.&rdquo; She did not say
      anything in showing me these passages, and I found something in her action
      touchingly childlike and elemental, as well as curiously heathenish. It
      was as if some poor pagan had brought me his fetish to test its effect
      upon me. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;those are things that we hardly know what to do
      with in our philosophy. They seem to be said as with authority, and yet,
      somehow, we cannot admit their validity in a philosophical inquiry as to a
      future life. Aren&rsquo;t they generally taken to mean that we shall be unhappy
      or happy hereafter, rather than that we shall be or not be at all? And
      what is believing? Is it the mere act of acknowledgement, or is it
      something more vital, which expresses itself in conduct?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not try to say. In fact she did not answer at all. Whatever point
      was in her mind she did not, or could not, debate it. I perceived, in a
      manner, that her life was so largely subliminal that if she had tried she
      could not have met my question any more than if she had not had the gift
      of speech at all. But, in her inarticulate fashion, she had exposed to me
      a state of mind which I was hardly withheld by the decencies from
      exploring. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that psychology almost begins by rejecting
      the authority of these sayings, and that while we no longer deny anything,
      we cannot allow anything merely because it has been strongly affirmed.
      Supposing that there is a life after this, how can it be denied to one and
      bestowed upon another because one has assented to a certain supernatural
      claim and another has refused to do so? That does not seem reasonable, it
      does not seem right. Why should you base your conclusion as to that life
      upon a promise and a menace which may not really refer to it in the sense
      which they seem to have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it all there is?&rdquo; she asked, and Alderling burst into his laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;s got you there, Wanhope. When it comes to polemics
      there&rsquo;s nothing like the passive obstruction of Mrs. Alderling. Marion
      might never have been an early Christian herself--I think she&rsquo;s an
      inexpugnable pagan--but she would have gone round making it awfully
      uncomfortable for the other unbelievers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said to him, and I never could decide how much she was in
      earnest, &ldquo;that I can&rsquo;t believe till you do. I couldn&rsquo;t take the risk of
      keeping on without you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alderling followed her in-doors, where she now went to put the book away,
      with the mock addressed to me, &ldquo;Did you ever know such a stubborn woman?&rdquo;
       <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      One conclusion from my observation of the Alderlings during the week I
      spent with them was that it is bad for a husband and wife to be constantly
      and unreservedly together, not because they grow tired of each other, but
      because they grow more intensely interested in each other. Children, when
      they come, serve the purpose of separating the parents; they seem to unite
      them in one care, but they divide them in their employments, at least in
      the normally constituted family. If they are rich, and can throw the care
      of the children upon servants, then they cannot enjoy the relief from each
      other that children bring to the mother who nurtures and teaches them, and
      to the father who must work for them harder than before. The Alderlings
      were not rich enough to have been freed from the wholesome
      responsibilities of parentage, but they were childless, and so they were
      not detached from the perpetual thought of each other. If they had only
      had different tastes, it might have been better, but they were both
      artists, she not less than he, though she no longer painted. When their
      common thoughts were not centred upon each other&rsquo;s being, they were
      centred on his work, which, viciously enough, was the constant
      reproduction of her visible personality. I could always see them studying
      each other, he with an eye to her beauty, she with an eye to his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was every now and then saying to her, &ldquo;Hold on, Marion,&rdquo; and staying
      her in some pose or movement, while he made mental note of it, and I was
      conscious of her preying upon his inmost thoughts and following him into
      the recesses of his reveries, where it is best for a man to be alone, even
      if he is sometimes a beast there. She was not like those wives who ask
      their husbands, when they do not happen to be talking, &ldquo;What are you
      thinking about?&rdquo; and I put this to her credit, till I realized that she
      had no need to ask, for she knew already. Now and then I saw him get up
      and shake himself restively, but I am bound to say in her behalf, that her
      pursuit of him seemed quite involuntary, and that she enjoyed it no more
      than he did. Twenty times I was on the point of asking, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
      people go in for a good long separation? Is there nothing to call you to
      Europe, Alderling? Haven&rsquo;t you got a mother, or sister, or some one that
      you could visit, Mrs. Alderling? It would do you both a world of good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it happened, oddly enough, that the Alderlings were as kinless as they
      were childless, and if he had gone to Europe he would have taken her with
      him, and prolonged their seclusion by the isolation in which people
      necessarily live in a foreign country. I found I was the only acquaintance
      who had visited them during the years of their retirement on the coast,
      where they had stayed, partly through his inertia, and partly from his
      superstition that he could paint better away from the ordinary
      associations and incentives; and they ceased, before I left, to get the
      good they might of my visit because they made me a part of their intimacy,
      instead of making themselves part of my strangeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a day or two, their queer experiences began to resume themselves,
      unabashed by my presence. These were mostly such as they had already more
      than hinted to me: the thought-transferences, and the unconscious hypnotic
      suggestions which they made to each other. There was more novelty in the
      last than the first. If I could trust them, and they did not seem to wish
      to exploit their mysteries for the effect on me, they were with each other
      because one or the other had willed it. She would say, if we were sitting
      together without him, &ldquo;I think Rupert wants me; I&rsquo;ll be back in a moment,&rdquo;
       and he, if she were not by, for some time, would get up with, &ldquo;Excuse me,
      I must go to Marion; she&rsquo;s calling me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had to take a great deal of this on faith; in fact, none of it was
      susceptible of proof; but I have not been able since to experience all the
      skepticism which usually replaces the impression left by sympathy with
      such supposed occurrences. The thing was not quite what we call uncanny;
      the people were so honest, both of them, that the morbid character of like
      situations was wanting. The events, if they could be called so, were not
      invited, I was quite sure, and they were varied by such diversions as we
      had in reach. I went blueberrying with Mrs. Alderling in the morning after
      she had got her breakfast dishes put away, in order that we might have
      something for dessert at our midday dinner; and I went fishing off the old
      stone crib with Alderling in the afternoon, so that we might have cunners
      for supper. The farmerfolks and fisherfolks seemed to know them and to be
      on tolerant terms with them, though it was plain that they still
      considered them probational in their fellow-citizenship. I do not think
      they were liked the less because they did not assume to be of the local
      sort, but let their difference stand, if it would. There was nothing
      countrified in her dress, which was frankly conventional; the short
      walking-skirt had as sharp a slant in front as her dinner-gown would have
      had, and he wore his knickerbockers--it was then the now-faded hour of
      knickerbockers--with an air of going out golfing in the suburbs. They
      stood on ceremony in addressing the natives, who might have been Jim or
      Liza to each other, but were always Mr. Donald or Mrs. Moody, with the
      Alderlings. They said they would not like being called by their first
      names themselves, and they did not see why they should take that freedom
      with others. Neither by nature nor by nurture were they out of the
      ordinary in their ideals, and it was by a sort of accident that they were
      so different in their realities. She had stayed on with him through the
      first winter in the place they had taken for the summer, because she
      wished to be with him, rather than because she wished to be there, and he
      had stayed because he had not just found the moment to break away, though
      afterwards he pretended a reason for staying. They had no more voluntarily
      cultivated the natural than the supernatural; he kindled the fire for her,
      and she made the coffee for him, not because they preferred, but because
      they must; and they had arrived at their common ground in the occult by
      virtue of being alone together, and not by seeking the solitude for the
      experiment which the solitude promoted. Mrs. Alderling did not talk less,
      nor he more, when either was alone with me, than when we were all
      together; perhaps he was more silent, and she not quite so much; she was
      making up for him in his absence as he was for her in her presence. But
      they were always hospitable and attentive hosts, and though under the
      peculiar circumstances of Mrs. Alderling&rsquo;s having to do the house-work I
      necessarily had to do a good many things for myself, there were certain
      little graces which were never wanting, from her hands: my curtains were
      always carefully drawn, and my coverlet triangularly opened, so that I did
      not have to pull it down myself. There was a freshly trimmed lamp on the
      stand at my bed-head, and a book and paper-cutter put there, with a
      decanter of whiskey and a glass of water. I note these things to you,
      because they are touches which help remove the sense of anything
      intentional in the occultism of the Alderlings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know whether I shall be able to impart the feeling of an obscure
      pathos in the case of Mrs. Alderling, which I certainly did not experience
      in Alderling&rsquo;s. Temperamentally he was less fitted to undergo the rigors
      of their seclusion than she was; in his liking to talk, he needed an
      audience and a variety of listening, and she, in her somewhat feline calm,
      could not have been troubled by any such need. You can be silent to
      yourself, but you cannot very well be loquacious, without danger of having
      the devil for a listener, if the old saying is true. Yet still, I felt a
      keener poignancy in her sequestration. Her beauty had even greater claim
      to regard than his eloquence. She was a woman who could have commanded a
      whole roomful with it, and no one would have wanted a word from her. She
      could only have been entirely herself in society, where, and in spite of
      everything that can be said against it, we can each, if we will, be more
      natural than out of it. The reason that most of us are not natural in it
      is that we want to play parts for which we are more or less unfit, and
      Marion Alderling never wished to play a part, I was sure. It would have
      sufficed her to be herself wherever she was, and the more people there
      were by, the more easily she could have been herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not able to say now how much of all this is observation of previous
      facts, and how much speculation based upon subsequent occurrences. At the
      best I can only let it stand for characterization. In the same interest I
      will add a fact in relation to Mrs. Alderling which ought to have its
      weight against any undue appeal I have been making in her behalf. Without
      in the least blaming her, I will say that I think that Mrs. Alderling ate
      too much. She must have had naturally a strong appetite, which her active
      life sharpened, and its indulgence formed a sort of refuge from the
      pressure of the intense solitude in which she lived, and which was all the
      more a solitude because it was _solitude à deux_. I noticed that beyond
      the habit of cooks she partook of the dishes she had prepared, and that
      after Alderling and I had finished dinner, and he was impatient to get at
      his pipe, she remained prolonging her dessert. One night, when he and I
      came in from the veranda, she was standing at the sideboard, bent over a
      saucer of something, and she made me think of a large tortoise-shell cat
      which has got at the cream. I expected in my nerves to hear her lap, and
      my expectation was heightened by the soft, purring laugh with which she
      owned that she was hungry, and those berries were so nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the risk of giving the effect of something sensuous, even sensual, in
      her, I find myself insisting upon this detail, which did not lessen her
      peculiar charm. As far as the mystical quality of the situation was
      concerned, I fancy your finding that rather heightened by her innocent
      _gourmandise_. You must have noticed how inextricably, for this life at
      least, the spiritual is trammeled in the material, how personal character
      and ancestral propensity seem to flow side by side in the same individual
      without necessarily affecting each other. On the moral side Mrs. Alderling
      was no more to be censured for the refuge which her nerves sought from the
      situation in over-eating than Alderling for the smoking in which he
      escaped from the pressure they both felt from one another; and she was not
      less fitted than he for their joint experience. <br /> <br /> <br />

    <p>
      I do not suppose it was with the notion of keeping her weight down that
      Mrs. Alderling rowed a good deal on the cove before the cottage; but she
      had a boat, which she managed very well, and which she was out in, pretty
      much the whole time when she was not cooking, or eating or sleeping, or
      roaming the berry-pastures with me, or sitting to Alderling for his
      Madonnas. He did not care for the water himself; he said he knew every
      inch of that cove, and was tired of it; but he rather liked his wife&rsquo;s
      going, and they may both have had an unconscious relief from each other in
      the absences which her excursions promoted. She swam as well as she rowed,
      and often we saw her going down water-proofed to the shore, where we
      presently perceived her pulling off in her bathing-dress. Well out in the
      cove she had the habit of plunging overboard, and after a good swim, she
      rowed back, and then, discreetly water-proofed again, she climbed the lawn
      back to the house. Now and then she took me out in her boat, but so far as
      I remember, Alderling never went with her. Once I ventured to ask him if
      he never felt anxious about her. He said no, he should not have been
      afraid to go with her, and she could take better care of herself than he
      could. Besides, by means of their telepathy they were in constant
      communion, and he could make her feel at any sort of chance, that he did
      not wish her to take it, and she would not. This was the only occasion
      when he treated their peculiar psychomancy boastfully, and the only
      occasion when I felt a distinct misgiving of his sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day before I left, Mrs. Alderling went down about eleven in the
      morning to her boat, and rowed out into the cove. She rowed far toward the
      other shore, whither, following her with my eyes from Alderling&rsquo;s window,
      I saw its ridge blotted out by a long low cloud. It was straight and level
      as a wall, and looked almost as dense, and I called Alderling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that fog won&rsquo;t come in before afternoon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We usually get it
      about four o&rsquo;clock. But even if it does,&rdquo; he added dreamily, &ldquo;Marion can
      manage. I&rsquo;d trust her anywhere in this cove in any kind of weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went back to his work, and painted away for five or six minutes. Then
      he asked me, still at the window, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that fog doing now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I should say it was making in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see Marion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she seems to be taking her bath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he painted a while before he asked, &ldquo;Has she had her dip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s getting back into her boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Alderling, in a tone of relief. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s good to beat any
      fog in these parts ashore. I wish you would come and look at this a
      minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went, and we lost ourselves for a time in our criticism of the picture.
      He was harder on it than I was. He allowed, _"C&rsquo;est un bon portrait_, as
      the French used to say of a faithful landscape, though I believe now the
      portrait can&rsquo;t be too good for them. I can&rsquo;t say about landscape. But in a
      Madonna I feel that there can be too much Marion, not for me, of course,
      but for the ideal, which I suppose we are bound to respect. Marion is not
      spiritual, but I would not have her less of the earth earthy, for all the
      angels that ever spread themselves &lsquo;in strong level flight.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I recognized the words from &ldquo;The Blessed Damozel,&rdquo; and I made bold to be
      so personal as to say, &ldquo;If her hair were a little redder than &lsquo;the color
      of ripe corn&rsquo; one might almost feel that the Blessed Damozel had been
      painted from Mrs. Alderling. It&rsquo;s the lingering earthiness in her that
      makes the Damozel so divine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that was a great conception. I wonder none of the fellows do that
      kind of thing now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed and said, &ldquo;Well, so few of them have had the advantage of seeing
      Mrs. Alderling. And besides, Rosettis don&rsquo;t happen every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the period, too. I always tell her that she belongs among the
      later eighteen sixties. But she insists that she wasn&rsquo;t even born then.
      Marion is tremendously single-minded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has her mind all on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked askance at me. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve noticed--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that your mind is all on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not half as much!&rdquo; he protested, fervidly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good for
      her, though of course I like it. That is, in a way. Sometimes it&rsquo;s rather
      too--&rdquo; He suddenly flung his brush from him, and started up, with a loudly
      shouted, &ldquo;Yes, yes! I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; and hurled himself out of the garret
      which he used for his studio, and cleared the stairs with two bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time I reached the outer door of the cottage, he was a dark blur in
      the white blur of the fog which had swallowed up the cove, and was rising
      round the house-walls from the grass. I heard him shouting, &ldquo;Marion!&rdquo; and
      a faint mellow answer, far out in the cove, &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; and then--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; and her answer &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; I heard him jump into a boat, and
      the thump of the oars in the row-locks, and then the rapid beat of the
      oars while he shouted, &ldquo;Keep calling!&rdquo; and she answered,--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will!&rdquo; and called &ldquo;Hello! Hello! Hello!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made my mental comment that this time their mystical means of
      communication was somehow not working. But after her last hello, no sound
      broke the white silence of the fog except the throb of Alderling&rsquo;s oars.
      She was evidently resting on hers, lest she should baffle his attempts to
      find her by trying to find him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose ten minutes or so had passed, when the dense air brought me the
      sound of low laughing that was also like the sound of low sobbing, and
      then I knew that they had met somewhere in the blind space. I began to
      hear rowing again, but only as of one boat, and suddenly out of the mist,
      almost at my feet, Alderling&rsquo;s boat shot up on the shelving beach, and his
      wife leaped ashore from it, and ran past me up the lawn, while he pulled
      her boat out on the gravel. She must have been trailing it from the stern
      of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      VI.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I was abroad when Mrs. Alderling died, but I heard that it was from a
      typhoid fever which she had contracted from the water in their well, as
      was supposed. The water-supply all along that coast is scanty, and that
      summer most of the wells were dry, and quite a plague of typhoid raged
      among the people from drinking the dregs. The fever might have gone the
      worse with her because of her over-fed robustness; at any rate it went
      badly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      I first heard of her death from Minver at the club, and I heard with still
      greater astonishment that Alderling was down there alone where she had
      died. Minver said that somebody ought to go down and look after the poor
      old fellow, but nobody seemed to feel it exactly his office. Certainly I
      did not feel it mine, and I thought it rather a hardship when a few days
      after I found a letter from Alderling at the club quite piteously
      beseeching me to come to him. He had read of my arrival home, in a stray
      New York paper, and he was firing his letter, he said, at the club, with
      one chance in a thousand of hitting me with it. Rulledge was by when I
      read it, and he decided, with that unsparing activity of his, where other
      people are concerned, that I must go; I certainly could not resist such an
      appeal as that. He had a vague impression, he said, of something weird in
      the situation down there, and I ought to go and pull Alderling out of it;
      besides, I might find my account in it as a psychologist. I hesitated a
      day, out of self-respect, or self-assertion, and then, the weather coming
      on suddenly hot, in the beginning of September, I went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I had meant to go, all along, but I was not so glad when I
      arrived, as I might have been if Alderling had given me a little warmer
      welcome. His mood had changed since writing to me, and the strongest
      feeling he showed at seeing me was what affected me very like a cold
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had broken in on a solitude in that place before, I was now the
      intruder upon a desolation. Alderling was living absolutely alone, except
      for the occasional presence of a neighboring widow--all the middle-aged
      women there are widows, with dim or dimmer memories of husbands lost off
      the Banks, or elsewhere at sea--who came in to get his meals and make his
      bed, and then had instructions to leave. It was in one of her prevailing
      absences that I arrived with my bag, and I had to hammer a long time with
      the knocker on the open door before Alderling came clacking down the
      stairs in his slippers from the top of the house, and gave me his somewhat
      defiant greeting. I could almost have said that he did not recognize me at
      the first bleared glance, and his inability, when he realized who it was,
      to make me feel at home, encouraged me to take the affair into my own
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked frightfully altered, but perhaps it was the shaggy beard that he
      had let grow over his poor, lean muzzle, that mainly made the difference.
      His clothes hung gauntly upon him, and he had a weak-kneed stoop. His coat
      sleeves were tattered at the wrists, and one of them showed the white
      lining at the elbow. I simply shuddered at his shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you smoke?&rdquo; he asked huskily, almost at the first word, and with an
      effect of bewilderment in his hospitality that almost made me shed tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not just yet, Alderling,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Shall I go to my old room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go anywhere,&rdquo; he answered, and he let me carry my bag to the chamber
      where I had slept before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite as his wife would have arranged it, even to the detail of a
      triangular portion of the bedding turned down as she used to do it for me.
      The place was well aired and dusted, and gave me the sense of being as
      immaculately clean and fresh as Alderling was not. He sat down in a chair
      by the window, and he remained, while I laid out my things and made my
      brief toilet, unabashed by those incidents for which I did not feel it
      necessary to banish him, if he liked staying.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had supper by-and-by, a very well-cooked meal of fried fresh cod and
      potatoes, with those belated blackberries which grow so sweet when they
      hang long on the canes into September. There was a third plate laid, and I
      expected that when the housekeeper had put the dishes on the table, she
      would sit down with us, as the country-fashion still is, but she did not
      reappear till she came in with the dessert and coffee. Alderling ate
      hungrily, and much more than I had remembered his doing, but perhaps I
      formerly had the impression of Mrs. Alderling&rsquo;s fine appetite so strongly
      in mind that I had failed to note his. Certainly, however, there was a
      difference in one sort which I could not be mistaken in, and that was in
      his not talking. Her mantle of silence had fallen upon him, and whereas he
      used hardly to give me a chance in the conversation, he now let me do all
      of it. He scarcely answered my questions, and he asked none of his own;
      but I saw that he liked being talked to, and I did my best, shying off
      from his sorrow, as people foolishly do, and speaking banalities about my
      trip to Europe, and the Psychological Congress in Geneva, and the fellows
      at the club, and heaven knows what rot else.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened, but I do not know whether he heard much of my clack, and I
      got very tired of it myself at last. When I had finished my blackberries,
      he asked mechanically, in an echo of my former visit, with a repetition of
      his gesture towards the coffee-pot, &ldquo;More?&rdquo; I shook my head, and then he
      led the way out to the veranda, stopping to get his pipe and tobacco from
      the mantel on the way. But when we sat down in the early falling September
      twilight outside, he did not light his pipe, letting me smoke my cigarette
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you off your tobacco?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t smoke,&rdquo; he answered, but he did not explain why, and I did not
      feel authorized to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talk went on as lopsidedly as before, and I began to get sleepy. I
      made bold to yawn, but Alderling did not mind that, and then I made bold
      to say that I thought I would go to bed. He followed me indoors, saying
      that he would go to bed, too. The hall was lighted from a hanging-lamp and
      two clear-burning hand-lamps which the widow had put for us on a small
      table. She had evidently gone home, and left us to ourselves. He took one
      lamp and I the other, and he started up stairs before me. If he were not
      coming down again, he meant to let the hanging-lamp burn, and I had
      nothing to say about that; but I suggested, concerning the wide-open door
      behind me, &ldquo;Shall I close the door, Alderling?&rdquo; and he answered, without
      looking round, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t shut it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the way into my room, and he sat down as when I had come, and
      absently watched my processes of getting into bed. There was something
      droll, and yet miserable, in his behavior. At first, I thought he might be
      staying merely for the comfort of a human presence, and again, I thought
      he might be afraid, for I felt a little creepy myself, for no assignable
      reason, except that Absence, which he must have been incomparably more
      sensible of than I. From certain ineffectual movements that he made, and
      from certain preliminary noises in his throat, which ended in nothing, I
      decided that he wished to say something to me, tell me something, and
      could not. But I was selfishly sleepy, and it seemed to me that anything
      he had on his mind would keep there till morning, at least, and that if he
      got it off on mine now, it might give me a night of wakeful speculation.
      So when I got into bed and pulled the sheet up under my chin, I said,
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want to turn you out, old fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared, and answered, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and went without other words, carrying his
      lamp with him and moving with a weak-kneed shuffle, like a very old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was going to leave the door open behind him, but I called out, &ldquo;I wish
      you&rsquo;d shut me in, Alderling,&rdquo; and after a hesitation, he came back and
      closed the door. <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      VII.
    </h3>
    <p>
      We breakfasted as silently on his part as we had supped, but when we had
      finished, and I was wondering what he was going to let me do with myself,
      and on the whole what the deuce I had come for, he said, in the longest
      speech I had yet had from him, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to come up and see what
      I&rsquo;ve been doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said I should like it immensely, and he led the way up stairs, as far As
      his attic studio. The door of that, like the other doors in the house,
      stood open, and I got the emotion which the interior gave me, full force,
      at the first glance. The place was so startlingly alive with that dead
      woman on a score of canvases in the character in which he had always
      painted her, that I could scarcely keep from calling out; but I went
      about, pretending to examine the several Madonnas, and speaking rubbish
      about them, while he stood stoopingly in the midst of them like the little
      withered old man he looked. When I had emptied myself of my chaff, I
      perceived that the time had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      I glanced about for a seat, and was going to take that in which Mrs.
      Alderling used to pose for him, but he called out with sudden sharpness,
      &ldquo;Not that!&rdquo; and without appearing to notice, I found a box which I
      inverted, and sat down on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about your wife, Alderling,&rdquo; I said, and he answered with a sort
      of scream, &ldquo;I wanted you to ask me! Why didn&rsquo;t you ask me before? What did
      you suppose I got you here for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he shrank down, a miserable heap, in his own chair, and bowed
      his hapless head and cried. It was more affecting than any notion I can
      give you of it, and I could only wait patiently for his grief to wash
      itself out in one of those paroxysms which come to bereavement and leave
      it somehow a little comforted when they pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was waiting, for the stupid reasons you will imagine, to let you speak
      first,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but here in her presence I couldn&rsquo;t hold in any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He asked with strange eagerness, &ldquo;You noticed that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I chose to feign that he meant in the pictures. &ldquo;Over and over again,&rdquo; I
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would not have my feint. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean in these wretched caricatures!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; I assented provisionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean her very self, listening, looking, living--waiting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether I had insanity or sorrow to deal with, I could not gainsay the
      unhappy man, and I only said what I really felt: &ldquo;Yes, the place seems
      strangely full of her. I wish you would tell me about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He asked, with a certain slyness, &ldquo;Have you heard anything about her
      already? At the club? From that fool woman in the kitchen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, no, Alderling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing whatever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed relieved of whatever suspicion he felt, but he said finally, and
      with an air of precaution, &ldquo;I should like to know just how much you mean
      by the place seeming full of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I suppose the association of her personality with the whole house,
      and especially this room. I didn&rsquo;t mean anything preternatural, I
      believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t believe in a life after death?&rdquo; he demanded with a kind of
      defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought this rather droll, seeing what his own position had been, but
      that was not the moment for the expression of my amusement. &ldquo;The tendency
      is to a greater tolerance of the notion,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Men like James and
      Royce, among the psychologists, and Shaler, among the scientists, scarcely
      leave us at peace in our doubts, any more, much less our denials.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said, as if he had forgotten the question: &ldquo;They called it a very light
      case, and they thought she was getting well. In fact, she did get well,
      and then--there was a relapse. They laid it to her eating some fruit which
      they allowed her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alderling spoke with a kind of bitter patience, but in my own mind I was
      not able to put all the blame on the doctors. Neither did I blame that
      innocently earthy creature, who was of no more harm in her strong appetite
      than any other creature which gluts its craving as simply as it feels it.
      The sense of her presence was deepened by the fact of those childlike
      self-indulgences which Alderling&rsquo;s words recalled to me. I made no
      comment, however, and he asked gloomily, as if with a return of his
      suspicion, &ldquo;And you haven&rsquo;t heard of anything happening afterward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you refer to,&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;but I can safely say I
      haven&rsquo;t, for I haven&rsquo;t heard anything at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They contended that it _didn&rsquo;t_ happen,&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;She died, they
      said, and by all the tests she had been dead two whole days. She died with
      her hand in mine. I was not trying to hold her back; she had a kind of
      majestic preoccupation in her going, so that I would not have dared to
      detain her if I could. You&rsquo;ve seen them go, and how they seem to draw
      those last, long, deep breaths, as if they had no thought in the world but
      of the work of getting out of it. When her breathing stopped I expected it
      to go on, but it did not go on, and that was all. Nothing startling,
      nothing dramatic, just simple, natural, _like her!_ I gave her hand back,
      I put it on her breast myself, and crossed the other on it. She looked as
      if she were sleeping, with that faint color hovering in her face, which
      was not wasted, but I did not make-believe about it; I accepted the fact
      of her death. In your &lsquo;Quests of the Occult,&rsquo;&rdquo; Alderling broke off, with a
      kind of superiority that was of almost the quality of contempt, &ldquo;I believe
      you don&rsquo;t allow yourself to be daunted by a diametrical difference of
      opinion among the witnesses of an occurrence, as to its nature, or as to
      its reality, even?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not exactly that,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I think I argued that the
      passive negation of one witness ought not to invalidate the testimony of
      another as to his experience. One might hear and see things, and strongly
      affirm them, and another, absorbed in something else, or in a mere
      suspense of the observant faculties, might quite as honestly declare that
      so far as his own knowledge was concerned, nothing of the kind happened. I
      held that in such a case, counter-testimony should not be allowed to
      invalidate the testimony for the fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is what I meant,&rdquo; said Alderling. &ldquo;You say it more clearly in
      the book, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      VIII.
    </h3>
    <p>
      He began again, more remotely from the affair in hand than he had left
      off, as if he wanted to give himself room for parley with my possible
      incredulity. &ldquo;You know how it was with Marion about my not believing that
      I should live again. Her notion was a sort of joke between us, especially
      when others were by, but it was a serious thing with her, in her heart.
      Perhaps it had originally come to her as a mere fancy, and from
      entertaining it playfully, she found herself with a mental inmate that
      finally dispossessed her judgment. You remember how literally she brought
      those Scripture texts to bear on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. May I say that it was very affecting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Affecting!&rdquo; Alderling repeated in a tone of amaze at the inadequacy of my
      epithet. &ldquo;She was always finding things that bore upon the point. After
      awhile she got to concealing them, as if she thought they annoyed me. They
      never did; they amused me; and when I saw that she had something of the
      sort on her mind, I would say, &lsquo;Well, out with it, Marion!&rsquo; She would
      always begin, &lsquo;Well, you may laugh!&rsquo;&rdquo; and as he repeated her words
      Alderling did laugh, forlornly, and as I must say, rather bloodcurdlingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not prompt him to go on, but he presently did so himself,
      desolately enough. &ldquo;I suppose, if I was in her mind at all in that supreme
      moment, when she seemed to be leaving this life behind with such a solemn
      effect of rating it at nothing, it may have been a pang to her that I was
      not following her into the dark, with any ray of hope for either of us.
      She could not have returned from it with the expectation of convincing me,
      for I used to tell her that if one came back from the dead, I should
      merely know that he had been mistaken about being dead, and was giving me
      a dream from his trance. She once asked me if I thought Lazarus was not
      really dead, with a curious childlike interest in the miracle, and she was
      disheartened when I reminded her that Lazarus had not testified of any
      life hereafter, and it did not matter whether he had been really dead or
      not when he was resuscitated, as far as that was concerned. Last year, we
      read the Bible a good deal together here, and to tease her I pretended to
      be convinced of the contrary by the very passages that persuaded her. As
      she told you, she did not care for herself. You remember that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Distinctly,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was always so. She never cared. I was perfectly aware that if she
      could have assured life hereafter to me, she would have given her life
      here to do it. You know how some women, when they are married, absolutely
      give themselves up, try to lose themselves in the behoof of their
      husbands? I don&rsquo;t say it rightly; there are no words that will express the
      utterness of their abdication.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and it was one of the facts which most
      interested me in Mrs. Alderling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I wasn&rsquo;t worthy of it? No man is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a question of that in my mind; I don&rsquo;t believe that occurred to
      me. It was the _Ding an sich_ that interested me, or as it related itself
      to her, and not the least as it related itself to you. Such a woman&rsquo;s
      being is a cycle of self-sacrifice, so perfect, so essential, from birth
      to death, as to exclude the notion of volition. She is what she does. Of
      course she has to put her sacrifice into words from time to time, but its
      true language is acts, and the acts themselves only clumsily express it.
      There is a kind of tyranny in it for the man, of course. It requires
      self-sacrifice to be sacrificed to, and I don&rsquo;t suppose a woman has any
      particular merit in what is so purely natural. It appears pathetic when it
      is met with ingratitude or rejection, but when it has its way it is no
      more deserving our reverence than eating or sleeping. It astonishes men
      because they are as naturally incapable of it as women are capable of it.&rdquo;
       I was mounted and was riding on, forgetful of Alderling, and what he had
      to tell me, if he had anything, but he recalled me to myself by having
      apparently forgotten me, for when I paused, he took up his affair at a
      quite different point, and as though that were the question in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That gift, or knack, or trick, or whatever it was, of one compelling the
      presence of the other by thinking or willing it, was as much mine as hers,
      and she tried sometimes to get me to say that I would use it with her if
      she died before I did; and if she were where the conditions were opposed
      to her coming to me, my will would help her to overcome the hinderance;
      our united wills would form a current of volition that she could travel
      back on against all obstacles. I don&rsquo;t know whether I make myself clear?&rdquo;
       he appealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, perfectly,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It is very curious.&rdquo; He said in a kind of muse,
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know just where I was.&rdquo; Then he began again, &ldquo;Oh, yes! It was at
      the ceremony--down there in the library. Some of the country people came
      in; I suppose they thought they ought, and I suppose they wanted to; it
      didn&rsquo;t matter to me. I had sent for Doctor Norrey, as soon as the relapse
      came, and he was there with me. Of course there was the minister,
      conducting the services. He made a prayer full of helpless repetitions,
      which I helplessly noticed, and some scrambling remarks, mostly
      misdirected at me, affirming and reaffirming that the sister they had lost
      was only gone before, and that she was now in a happier world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The singing and the praying and the preaching came to an end, and then
      there was that soul-sickening hush, that exanimate silence, of which the
      noise of rustling clothes and scraping feet formed a part, as the people
      rose in the hall, where chairs had been put for them, leaving me and
      Norrey alone with Marion. Every fibre of my frame recognized the moment of
      parting, and protested. A tremendous wave of will swept through me and
      from me, a resistless demand for her presence, and it had power upon her.
      I heard her speak, and say, as distinctly as I repeat the words, &lsquo;I will
      come for you!&rsquo; and the youth and the beauty that had been growing more and
      more wonderful in her face, ever since she died, shone like a kind of
      light from it. I answered her, &lsquo;I am ready now!&rsquo; and then Norrey scuffled
      to his feet, with a conventional face of sympathy, and said, &lsquo;No hurry, my
      dear Alderling,&rsquo; and I knew he had not heard or seen anything, as well as
      I did afterwards when I questioned him. He thought I was giving them
      notice that they could take her away. What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How what do I think?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that it happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something in Alderling&rsquo;s tone and manner that made me, instead
      of answering directly that I did not, temporize and ask, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because--because,&rdquo; and Alderling caught his breath, like a child that is
      trying to keep itself from crying, &ldquo;because _I_ don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He broke into a
      sobbing that seemed to wrench and tear his poor little body, and if I had
      thought of anything to say, I could not have said it to his headlong grief
      with any hope of assuaging it. &ldquo;I am satisfied now,&rdquo; he said, at last,
      wiping his wet face, and striving for some composure of its trembling
      features, &ldquo;that it was all a delusion, the effect of my exaltation, of my
      momentary aberration, perhaps. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of saying what you really
      think,&rdquo; he added scornfully, &ldquo;with the notion of sparing me. You couldn&rsquo;t
      doubt it, or deny it, more completely than I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="ctr">
      <a href="images/illusp212.jpg"><img src="images/illusp212_th.jpg"
       alt="HE BROKE INTO A SOBBING THAT SEEMED TO WRENCH AND TEAR" /></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      I confess this unexpected turn struck me dumb. I did not try to say
      anything, and Alderling went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny that she is living, but I can&rsquo;t believe that I shall ever
      live to see her again, or if you prefer, die to see her. There is the play
      of the poor animal instinct, or the mechanical persistence of expectation
      in me, so that I can&rsquo;t shut the doors without the sense of shutting her
      out, can&rsquo;t put out the lights without feeling that I am leaving her in the
      dark. But I know it is all foolishness, as well as you do, all craziness.
      If she is alive it is because she believed she should live, and I shall
      perish because I didn&rsquo;t believe. I should like to believe, now, if only to
      see her again, but it is too late. If you disuse any member of your body,
      or any faculty of your mind, it withers away and if you deny your soul
      your soul ceases to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I found myself saying, &ldquo;That is very interesting,&rdquo; from a certain force of
      habit, which you have noted in me, when confronted with a novel instance
      of any kind. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I suggested, &ldquo;why not act upon the reverse of that
      principle, and create the fact by affirmation which you think your denial
      destroys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he repeated wearily, &ldquo;it is too late. You might as well ask the
      fakir who has held his arm upright for twenty years, till it has stiffened
      there, to restore the dry stock by exercise. It is too late, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, look here, Alderling,&rdquo; I pursued, beginning to taste the joy of
      argument. &ldquo;You say that your will had such power upon her after you knew
      her to be dead that you made her speak to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t say that now,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;I know now that it was a
      delusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you once had that power of summoning her to you, by strongly
      wishing for her presence, when you were both living here, why doesn&rsquo;t it
      stand to reason that you could do it still, if she is living there and you
      are living here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never had any such power,&rdquo; he replied, with the calm of absolute
      tragedy. &ldquo;That was a delusion too. I leave the doors open for her, night
      and day, because I must, but if she came I should know it was not she.&rdquo;
       <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      IX.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Of course you know your own business, my dear Acton, but if you think of
      using the story of the Alderlings--and there is no reason why you should
      not, for they are both dead, without kith or kin surviving, so far as I
      know, unless he has some relatives in Germany, who would never penetrate
      the disguise you could give the case--it seems to me that here is your
      true climax. But I necessarily leave the matter to you, for I shall not
      touch it at any point where we could come into competition. In fact, I
      doubt if I ever touch it at all, for though all psychology is in a manner
      dealing with the occult, still I think I have done my duty by that side of
      it, as the occult is usually understood; and I am shy of its grosser
      instances, as things that are apt to bring one&rsquo;s scientific poise into
      question. However, you shall be the judge of what is best for you to do,
      when you have the whole story, and I will give it you without more ado,
      merely premising that I have a sort of shame for the aptness of the
      catastrophe. I shall respect you more if I hear that you agree with me as
      to the true climax of the tragedy, and have the heroism to reject the
      final event.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stayed with Alderling nearly a week, and I will own that I bored myself.
      In fact, I am not sure but we bored each other. At any rate, when I told
      him, the night before I intended going, that I meant to leave him in the
      morning, he seemed resigned, or indifferent, or perhaps merely
      inattentive. From time to time we had recurred to the matter of his
      experience, or his delusion, but with apparently increasing impatience on
      his part, and certainly decreasing interest on mine; so that at last I
      think he was willing to have me go. But in the morning he seemed
      reluctant, and pleaded with me to stay a few days longer with him. I
      alleged engagements, more or less unreal, for I was never on such terms
      with Alderling that I felt I need make any special sacrifice to him. He
      gave way, suspiciously, rather, and when I came down from my room after
      having put the last touches to my packing, I found him on the veranda
      looking out to seaward, where a heavy fog-bank hung.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will sense here the sort of _patness_ which I feel cheapens the
      catastrophe; and yet, as I consider it, again, the fact is not without its
      curious importance, and its bearing upon what went before. I do not know
      but it gives the whole affair a relief which it would not otherwise have.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was to have driven me to the station, some miles away, before noon, and
      I supposed we should sit down together, and try to have some sort of talk
      before I went. But Alderling appeared to have forgotten about my going,
      and after a while, took himself off to his studio, and left me alone to
      watch the inroads of the fog. It came on over the harbor rapidly, as on
      that morning when Mrs. Alderling had been so nearly lost in it, and
      presently the masts and shrouds of the shipping at anchor were sticking up
      out of it as if they were sunk into a body as dense as the sea under them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I amused myself watching it blot out one detail of the prospect after
      another, while the fog-horn lowed through it, and the bell-buoy, far out
      beyond the light-house ledge, tolled mournfully. The milk-white mass moved
      landward, and soon the air was blind with the mist which hid the grass
      twenty yards away. There was an awfulness in the silence, which nothing
      broke but the lowing of the horn, and the tolling of the bell, except when
      now and then the voice of a sailor came through it, like that of some
      drowned man sending up his hail from the bottom of the bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly I heard a joyful shout from the attic overhead:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming! I am coming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Alderling calling out through his window, and then a cry came from
      over the water, which seemed to answer him, but which there is no reason
      in the world to believe was not a girlish shout from one of the yachts,
      swallowed up in the fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lunging descent of the successive stairways followed, and he burst
      through the doorway beside me, and without heeding me, ran bareheaded down
      the sloping lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed, with what notion of help or hinderance I should not find it
      easy to say, but before I reached the water&rsquo;s edge--in fact I never did
      reach it, and had some difficulty making my way back to the house,--I
      heard the rapid throb of the oars in the row-locks as he pulled through
      the white opacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      You know the rest, for it was the common property of our enterprising
      press at the time, when the incident was fully reported, with my
      ineffectual efforts to be satisfactorily interviewed as to the nothing I
      knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oarless boat was found floating far out to sea after the fog lifted.
      It was useless to look for Alderling&rsquo;s body, and I do not know that any
      search was made for it.

and Project Gutenberg Distributed Proofreaders


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
&ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo;, WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
